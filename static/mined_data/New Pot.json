I use it almost every day. Cleans right up, no problem. Be careful, the handle can get hot.","1":"Still non-stick after a month of use","2":"I have quite a few pots and pans in this brand and absolutely love them all.  Just make sure you never put them in the dishwasher","3":"This saucepan is just the right size and is easy to use and to clean.","4":"I cooked frozen veggies as normal but they were completely done a lot sooner. Cleanup is a breeze. I recommend this sauce pot.","5":"Added to set","6":"E-Z 2 clean","7":"I really really like this product that I bought three!","8":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0I've been looking to replace my small pot. After tirelessly researching I saw this one on Prime Day. The reviews were positive so I decided to purchase.  So far I'm impressed with how easy it is to cook on it. The surface is like butter as to how easy food slides off. I'm hopieful it won't turn out like previous pots I've have where the coating starts peeling overtime.","9":"It\u2019s a good pot and well priced, an essential for my newly started kitchen. Cleaning it is super easy and I haven\u2019t had any problems cooking in it. (Any problems that weren\u2019t my fault anyway.)"}}

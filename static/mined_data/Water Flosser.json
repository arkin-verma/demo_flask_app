I have to refill it twice when I use it, take the tip off and refill. Does a good job and the 2 tips definitely have different power streams of water. Very pleased with this.","1":"One drop onto tiled floor and our couple-week old unit was permanently broken. Replacement tips do not appear to be purchasable.","2":"I gave this product four stars because the product isn\u2019t rechargeable and requires batteries. Besides that I do enjoy this water flosser. My teeth are a bit crowed so I have to make sure I floss well because food gets stuck in between them easily. This water flosser is not only refreshing on the gums but it works very well and gets the food out quickly! I love that it isn\u2019t too intense on the gums because my teeth and gums can tend to be sensitive. I do feel the price is affordable and the product is priced righted.","3":"The reason this doesn't receive 5 stars is because it uses 2 AA batteries and is not rechargeable.  This has left me scratching my head.  I have never used a cordless water flosser that was not rechargeable.  I wish I could have used this til the batteries went dead to see how long a set of batteries holds up in this.  I normally have to charge my rechargeable cordless once a month.  After considering this longer, I realize there is an option for me to use rechargeable batteries in it.  This will eliminate throwing away batteries.I have been using it about 4 or 5 days now.  The battery is still strong.This is a basic water flosser, but rivals the name brand one.  The jet of water is soft that I don't feel like I am blasting my gums away but effective that I can feel it working in between my teeth.There is one button.  One speed.  There are two different tips- low pressure and high pressure.  I have  been using the high pressure one, I think.4 stars: I was and am disappointed this is not a rechargeable.  As far as quality of the jet stream it works great.  Better than most if not all of the generic ones I have tried.  The price is very fair, but to have to keep a supply of batteries to use it, I probably won't continue to use it once these batteries go dead since I do not have rechargeable batteries on hand.  I use batteries when I need to, but if there is an alternative (like recharging) instead of putting batteries in the garbage can, I am going to go with that choice.","4":"I got this for my son who doesn\u2019t brush or floss well and was getting food stuck in his teeth. It works well, It\u2019s like a mini pressure washer for the teeth! It\u2019s pretty powerful, it shoots water to the ceiling. It\u2019s a bit messy for my son, but with some practice, I think it will be worth the mess. For now, I am helping him and  we are practicing using it in the shower until he gets the hang of it.  It works better for him that it\u2019s cordless and pretty simple to use. Battery charged. Water tank holds enough water to cover all his teeth. The base is large and it stands well on it\u2019s own when not used. B\/c messy, I plan to use it 1 times per week and not daily. Overall, It\u2019s good for regular teeth health maintenance and plaque control.","5":"This has left me scratching my head. I've in no way used a cordless water flosser that became no longer rechargeable. I wish i may want to have used this until the batteries went lifeless to see how long a set of batteries holds up on this. I typically should charge my rechargeable cordless as soon as a month. After thinking about this longer, i realize there may be an choice for me to use rechargeable batteries in it. This will put off throwing away batteries. This comes with 2 batteries. It does now not have an choice to price it. It's miles best powered through batteries. It has two stress options- high and coffee. Two guidelines are provided, the only with the blue area has a better strain than the only with out a blue facet. The water is straightforward to refill. You simply open the flap and pour water internal.","6":"My favorite invention in the last few years has to be the water flosser. They just make it so much easier to floss my teeth and get my kids to floss there\u2019s. We have a family one with different attachments for each of us that sits on the counter in the bathroom, but I wanted one that I could use when traveling. So when I came across this Amazon Basics HydroClean Cordless Water Flosser I figured it would be worth a try.It\u2019s definitely a basic model, there are not a bunch of modes or options to chose from. But it does work very well for what it is and the price point. It does a good job of getting everything out from between my teeth and it is compact and easy to use.","7":"I have a water flosser but it is a bit large (although nice) and I really want one I can bring with me on travel. In particular I was looking for one where the reservoir was completely sealed to help minimize any water leakage when packed away after using. This flosser does have that, though one annoyance is the position of the fill hole is kind of awkward, though you can detach the reservoir to make it fit in to various awkward size sinks at hotels good enough.I like that it takes AA batteries instead of rechargeable, as I don't want to have to worry about leaving some random cord behind or finding out it is dead when I go to use it and waiting for it to recharge. It came with two AA batteries, though I ended up using lithium AAs instead of alkaline so they last and won't leak when I have it stored away between trips (I have a bigger flosser I love already at home).The flosser works well and comes with two tips: a high pressure tip and a low pressure tip. I haven't used the high pressure one much as the low pressure tip meets my day-to-day needs just fine. The water flosser produces a good amount of water flow and the reservoir is large enough to hold enough for one run through the mouth. The reservoir is nice and sealed up and so I can hold it at all kinds of angles to really get the teeth flossed from all sides.I was a bit skeptical buying a Amazon Basic brand water flosser, but it has been really working well so far, so great job Amazon!","8":"I\u2019ve owned several of the name brand water flossers before, but this was my first portable generic version.Included in the box was the water flosser, 2 x AA batteries, manual, and two tips. One tip for low flow and one tip for high flow. The water pressure from the water flosser was quite good, almost as powerful as my name brand countertop version. If i were to guess the highflow tip felt equivalent to about an 8 out of the 10 max setting on my water pik.In order to install the batteries it uses a coin slot to unscrew cover, when i slid off the water tank the first time my battery slot popped open with it, but subsequently that issue disappeared. The water flosser is quite thick, and i have small hands so it did not feel very ergonomic holding it with one hand.  Filling the water tank was a little annoying as u can only fill it through a hole, because access is limited through that hole, cleaning the tank is difficult. I also was not a fan that there wasn\u2019t a rechargeable battery built into this device, nor any ability to run this off ac outlet.","9":"I started out years ago with a \"standard\" waterpik flosser and loved it, but after moving and losing a lot of counter space, I was ready to try a cordless one. This is just as effective as the full size waterpik. It is easy to use and clean."}}

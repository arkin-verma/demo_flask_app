When I got them, something was kinda off. These were just a tad too short so my heel was right on top of the lip on the back. Later on that day I ordered the 10.5-11.5s so I could try those instead. I got them yesterday and holy hell it took me all day to decide which ones to keep. The bigger pair is BIG but my feet fit perfectly into the insole and they\u2019re a lot more comfortable. The strap is a little more loose, naturally but not too much of an issue for me. I\u2019d walk around in one pair then switch off, each time I\u2019d think ok these feel a lot better, no THESE feel a lot better. The strap on the smaller pair fits nicely, not too snug but the fact that my heel hangs off the back just a teensy bit makes all the difference. It\u2019s definitely uncomfortable. I\u2019m going with the 10.5-11.5s.I did read a lot of other reviews to get more info as I am worried that the larger pair will stretch out. From what I\u2019ve gathered, it sounds like none of these sandals are actually all made the same, all sizes are not the same exact size, there\u2019s deformities in each sandal. I guess we just need to deal with the trial and error if we receive a wonky pair.All in all I\u2019m happy with the bigger pair. They\u2019re extremely comfortable and I love the color. I work from home, I\u2019m in a new house and my resolution is to keep the floors more clean, everyone must take their shoes off at the door so these are a great option for inside house slippers. I definitely won\u2019t be wearing them out in public or even the backyard.","1":"After reading some of the mixed reviews, I was hesitant about getting these, but I needed new slippers. I\u2019m a size 7.5 in most shoes and was torn between getting the women\u2019s 6-7 or 7.5-8.5. I eventually decided to get the 7.5-8.5 size to account for the raised edge and for any shrinkage that might happen because it\u2019s so hot and humid in NY lately. They\u2019re very roomy around the band but otherwise they fit perfectly. They do however look very big when I\u2019m not wearing them but once they\u2019re on your feet, they look normal-ish. I don\u2019t mind since I plan to only wear them indoors. They\u2019re also very supportive and comfortable to walk in. They have just the right amount of softness and firmness while still being very lightweight. When my mom tried them on for a bit, she wanted a pair as well.","2":"They are very soft and dirt does not stick to them, so I can go into the backyard wearing these and walk right into the house even if a bit wet. However, they catch on everything and I have almost fallen several times while walking on a hardwood floor or just moving one foot too close to the other, very strong grip on these, a trip hazard, so be aware. Also, they started to split a bit on the right side of the right tow, but I am wearing them a lot, will probably last an entire a year or less.","3":"As you can see I have bad feet. I retain fluid bad so my feet and legs swell at times. I also have issues with my toes going numb A LOT and honestly I'm a whiney person when it comes to shoes and my feet. First I usually wear a size 6 1\/2 but with swelling issues I can go up to a 7-7 1\/2. I got the size 6-7 1\/2 and they fit great. I got these to wear in the house and I just ordered another pair to wear around outside. Very comfortable I also got another brand in same size but sending them back because they do not fit or feel as comfortable as these. Right now my feet are not as swollen but I know when they do swell these are still gonna fit cause they are not tight fitting. I'm really satisfied and the price was not bad. Support is good, I have RA too so that's something very important to me support, comfort and the softness not so much but they do not hurt my feet. I recommend to anyone with RA and issues with your toes.","4":"I hesitated on the purchase.. but SO glad I went for it! We have concrete floors at home, and I wear dress shoes at work every day.. so I NEEDED comfort shoes around the house. Your typical house shoes were NOT cutting it for me! I\u2019m so glad I got these. My feet are definitely spoiled now because I can\u2019t walk barefoot around the house or else my feet hurt so bad and I can instantly feel the pain! These are so great!!","5":"These have become my house shoes, for walking with a little cushioning on hardwood and tile floors, and even to run outside to water plants and such. They are cushiony soft, easy to slip on, washable (rinse with a hose if you're outside!).  There isn't any special arch support, but the cushioning makes it unnecessary.  I do feel they look like I am wearing  shoe boxes on my feet, because they are that big, but who cares when they're comfy!  I was worried that they're so thick that I would trip over my own feet in them, but it's not a problem at all. I ordered the 9-10 which are roomy, but I think the 8.5-9 would have been less clunky.  If I were at a swimming pool, these would be my choice to walk around it instead of flip-flops because the bottoms are channeled and less likely to slip (see photo).  For the money, I've already gotten my value from them in three weeks' wear. I found these from some instagram fashion thing that came up on my Facebook feed, and while I can't imagine wearing these in public (beyond a pool or nail salon) or as a fashion statement, they are THAT cushy that I understand if someone did. Friends who tried mine on were instantly sold on them and ordered a pair right away.","6":"I have plantar fasciitis and was looking for something to wear around the house. Any time I  would be sitting or laying for periods of time then get up my arches of both feet would hurt. I bought these after reading the reviews. I was not sure at first as they were really soft. However, I tried them out and I knew they worked because when I would take them off my feet would hurt like I was sitting again. They are not the prettiest shoe but I would defiantly recommend as a house shoe to relieve foot pain.","7":"I've had these slides for a few weeks now and they seem to be built to last but they are snug for my extremely wide (4E) feet. I typically buy Adidas adjustable slides a couple of sizes bigger and I did the same with these Cloud Slides but walking around in them feel clumsy because my feet keep bumping into things when I have them on and I've never had that problem with the Adidas slides. The thick sole really does provide a lot of cushion and support even for a heavy person like myself and they haven't lost any of it's original form as I wear them for hours on end around the house. If and whenever I find myself needing a new pair of slides, I hope to get something similar that's adjustable.","8":"My sister bought this for herself, of course, and for mom. At the time I didn\u2019t want one, but boy was I wrong. We have tile floors and being on your feet most of the day doing chores and cooking, your feet starts hurting. I ended up using my sisters one while doing laundry and OH MY GOODNESS. (I\u2019m not exaggerating) it\u2019s sooooo soft and comfortable. I used it the entire day around the house and almost forgot I had it on when I stepped out to garden. I\u2019d secretly use it whenever my sister is out. Let\u2019s just say, I ended up buying myself one before she finds out and throws a fit.","9":"I am not sure what I was expecting but these babies took my breathe away the instant I put them on. I literally stood in amazement for several minutes with my mouth wide open staring at my feet wondering if I had just stepped into another reality. I have sensitive skin on my feet. I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d and about 125 lbs so I\u2019m not packing on extra weight or anything. I was just hoping for some summer slippers for the house that were comfortable and helped me avoid touching my bare feet to carpet. These are still blowing me away after wearing them for a week. I feel like I\u2019m walking on air. And the price is amazing for these godsends!! AND the skin on my feet is healing. I\u2019m buying another pair to wear out and about (and probably many more) because I want to feel this good everywhere and all the time. My husband was laughing at me today \u2014 why are you so happy?? Literally, it\u2019s these shoes. I don\u2019t even like to write reviews but I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t share the bliss that is now my life. I want to buy a pair for everyone I know! So do yourself a favor and purchase these babies. I dare you to be in satisfied. Am I over selling? No, no I am not ha!Oh one other note to be aware of. I am a size 7.5 normally. I ordered the 7.5-8.5 for women and they fit but are ever so slightly too big to wear out and about, so I\u2019m getting the smaller 6-7 ones for outside. I\u2019m a bit of a clutz and am tripping over myself indoors but I like the larger size for lounging.","10":"Alright, you all win, they\u2019re actually that comfortable. I was hesitant to try them because I have a pretty lengthy history of plantar fasciitis, and need good quality shoes to fight the pain. These are so cushy that my heels don\u2019t feel any contact at all. I would say these have typical support, and I\u2019m not sure I would wear them for all day wear, but they\u2019re fantastic for around the house, running errands or pool days. The blue color is awesome too.","11":"These are super comfortable, soft slides. Beautiful colors. Love them.....but: I bought several different colors after my initial purchase because Ioved them so much. The ones to follow were widely different in size, i.e. huge compared to the first ones I bought. I ordered the same size each time, yet the actual  slide was not the same size. All were labeled size 42, but were measurably different in size. I ended up returning 2 times and finally kept one of the pairs. Now I have 2 pairs, both are size \"42\", yet extremely different in size. One I have for wearing barefoot and one I can wear with socks and barefoot, yet a bit loose. I am hesitant, but may try to order a size down, maybe my first pair was mislabeled in size and the ones that followed were an actual size 42?The short answer -- these are awesome if you want to roll the dice until you get the pair that fits you,  as you can't count on the size you order being the size that fits.","12":"Cheap little shoes but I wear them all the time. I wear these to the gym and use them in the shower so I feet don\u2019t touch the ground. I wear them around the house as well instead of slippers. They work better for me because sometimes my floors are really slippery and I don\u2019t have to worry about fine. They\u2019re very comfortable and I love the color. You can\u2019t go wrong with these things","13":"I absolutely love these and am so happy to have gotten them off of a recommendation from a friend. They are a fraction of the cost of other brands that achieve the same fit and comfort and I'm so happy I could get a good pair for a great price. I will say you should size up. I initially got the 10.5-11.5 size since I'm usually a size women's 11. I understand how the manufacturer classified it as an 11 because it technically is, however because it has the ridges on the side, it actually makes the slide where your foot hits it smaller. So when i was first trying them out, my heel and big toe kept hitting the edges. It wasn't uncomfortable, however, it was annoying. I decided to get the 12-13 size and it's a much much better fit!10\/10 would recommend and I will definitely be buying more pairs!","14":"The shoes are sooo comfy and has so many cute colors!! My only thing with this shoe and it could just be my foot but it\u2019s that the \u201cband\u201d is a little too thick\/ long so there isn\u2019t a lot of air flow. After a little bit of wearing them and then removing your foot you can feel the cold air. (If that makes sense) but don\u2019t get me wrong the shoes are sooo comfy and I won\u2019t be returning them! (I\u2019ll probably buy another pair too!)","15":"I did not know what to expect from these slides but from the instant I put them on I fell in love, feels like I'm walking on a cloud! I have a horrible back...top to bottom and when standing for more than 10\/15 minutes my entire back is on fire. With these slides I can stand for an hour or more with ZERO pain. Unbelievable. I highly recommend!","16":"I'm a true 7 and when I ordered the first pair ny big toe it the very end of the shoe and my heel barely fit. I ordered a size up and my foot fits in the show but the perimeter of the shoe is much bigger. I guess that's just how it has to be because I can't go smaller. So very odd that  the perimeter of the show has to grow with the length, but I bought to walk around in my kitchen so they serve the purpose. The second pair didn't come in a box. Came stuck inside eachother wrapped in plastic so bent out of shape a bit. Some people said use a blow dryer to mold better to your foot. At any rate, they seem ok. Can't speak to how durable they are yet.","17":"I got these for Mother\u2019s Day as a gift. I hate shoes but my feet hurt when I go barefoot. I was skeptical until I put them on and started walking in them. These are great. I even wear with socks when it\u2019s chilly they are that comfy. I don\u2019t wear in public but you could. Mine are dirty from wear so I will need another pair.","18":"I have these in 4 colors! I have awful feet and suffer from plantar fasciitis. I have the special inserts, the socks, the ice packs and the expensive shoes. Nothing has worked like these! I got some for my husband and he ordered two more pairs. I gave them as Xmas gifts and one of the girls said it cured her plantar fasciitis as well. My daughter tried to steal my black ones so I ordered her some and her boyfriend has bad knees and he ordered some as well. Are they the prettiest most trendy shoes? NO. Do my feet hurt when I'm on them all day? NO! So I ask again, \"Hey Bronax...where's my commission check?\" LOL! My friend asked me yesterday what was I going to do when winter came. I answered, \"Socks!\" haha! Seriously love these things!","19":"I love love love these shoes that I now have 3 pair.  I have horrible plantar faciatis, heel spurs and other problems with my feet and they are always hurting and for a while there I could barely walk.  I was told that I could not go barefoot anymore and I found these and they allow me to walk and move again.  I recommend these to anyone that has bad feet or tired feet because your feet will feel like you are walking on clouds.","20":"Bought these because we moved to FL and the floors are all tile. Awful for my back and hips!! These make a significant difference and keep me from getting super fatigued and hurting. However, after wearing them awhile and walking around the house, they get uncomfortable in the sense of sweaty feets. No breathability at all. You cannot expect to wear these for long bouts of time.","21":"I was surprised by how comfortable these sandals were! We have travertine floors and they kill my feet. I bought these to be inside support shoes for the hard floors and they\u2019re wonderful. My only complaint is they\u2019re ridiculously squeaky. We don\u2019t polish the floors or use cleaners so I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s the shoes? Anyway, I don\u2019t mind enough to not wear them!","22":"Okay, so I\u2019m an avid, honest review leaver because as most do, I go to reviews before making a purchase . I review everything I buy, just so people don\u2019t have to go back & forth with conflicting reviews . So, with that being said, these shoes are definitely not necessarily \u201ccute\u201d under most peoples standards, but tbh, I personally, will still wear them out in public because my \u201ccute\u201d fashion standards are different than most (I wear fuzzy slippers with 90% of my outfits out in public, also from Amazon) :P Besides the looks of these slippers \/ house shoes, the comfortability is immaculate . When I put them on, I was in disbelief, I know people said these were comfy, but I\u2019ve been let down before, but not with these ! These are 10\/10 comfortable & I will most definitely be buying more colors . HOWEVER, the sizing is weird\u2026 I usually wear 8.5-9 , but I usually size up just to be on the safe side so I got the 9-10 & I\u2019m SO glad I did because these literally fit perfect . They\u2019re not too big or too small, & I\u2019ve been debating on sizing up to the next size but I\u2019m scared they will be way too big \u2026 Anyhow, if you don\u2019t care about \u201cstyle\u201d but are big on comfort, BUY THESE . My feet constantly hurt from standing the majority of my day & once I put these on, it relieves the pressure . The mauve color is really pretty too ! (:","23":"They feel like rubber slides I just replaced with more cushion. They aren\u2019t extra bendable or fluffy, and they don\u2019t feel like marshmallows. They don\u2019t provide a lot of support either I find after a couple hours my feet still hurt and when I first started wearing them which is today it would make my legs want to smack each other. So leaning in towards the knees as if I was knot kneeded, so to correct that I just lean the other way. I don\u2019t know it\u2019s my first day wearing them my grandma thinks I will be able to wear them in and fix that support issue. Will I buy them again? No I\u2019d try another brand to get that dream cushion we have all seen in the ads. With that being said, I will continue to wear them- they get the job done and I don\u2019t feel like returning them and all that.Update the side\/upper edge of the shoe digs into my skin after wearing the shoes for a bit. Not like a blister or some type of wound but more of a sore feeling. But I did realize that my knees were hurting and I was really achy from doing a lot of work and I put these on it it seem to alleviate a lot of my walking pain.- update I\u2019ve had it for some time now and my feet now have dark marks where the edge of the shoe rubs on my skin. They still work the same way but I do find myself tripping here and there.","24":"I was the type of person who wore slippers all year round. I had trouble finding a good pair of affordable slippers and was tired of my feet sweating in the summer so I tried these. Wow. They are like walking on air. So comfortable and they weren't as ugly as I thought they were going to be either.","25":"I don\u2019t like going barefoot in the house. Used to wear a pair of cheap flip flops around just so I wasn\u2019t barefoot. I noticed my ankles and feet started to hurt when I wore those very often and wanted to find something comfy with a little more support. These do the trick! I usually wear a size 7.5 to 8 shoe so I picked the 7.5 to 8.5 size. They fit great and are really comfy for my lounging around the house days!","26":"Very comfortable but runs a little big, could have gone down half a size.","27":"Was hoping it would fit as snug as my Cushionaire sandals but they have a looser it. I usually wear a 9.5 size shoe \u2026 and the 9\/10 size sandal I bought is comfortable but almost on the verge of being too loose.Great for around the house or casual runs to grocery store, etc. I get compliments on them wherever I go ! They\u2019re very comfortable.","28":"I love the comfort of these indoor slides, however they are too tight for the width of my feet. If the strap was not as narrow they would be perfect. They feel like walking on air. Unfortunately I'm not wearing them due to the width and sticking with my crocs.","29":"Hands down best shower shoes! Comfy, great support, non-slip, I do NOT trip because the soles are so thick, they don't slide off while wet and walking back from my shower area down the haul from my dorm room, and don't make a squishing sound when walking. They do run a half size larger than order. Size 7 is size 7.5. However, being a half size larger actually made them more efficient.","30":"They aren\u2019t the prettiest slides I\u2019ve ever seen but my god they\u2019re comfortable. I wear them constantly. I wear a size 6 and the slides I got fit but they are a smidge roomy. I\u2019m not mad about it though\u2026 it\u2019s like walking on a cloud. Easy to clean and thick sponginess. I don\u2019t recommend to anyone who has mobility issues or balance issues - they have a bouncy to them. But I would buy again and think they\u2019re super comfortable.","31":"Super cute, I\u2019m an 8 and did 8.5 and it runs a little small.","32":"Okay so let me just say I wish I had bought this slide monthssssss ago!!! I don\u2019t like the look of them because they are bulky and low key ugly BUT they are so darn comfortable. Even more than Crocs!!! These are literally like walking on clouds. I loved them so much I ordered my mom 2 pairs because I knew she would love them since she has very tender feet and prefers to walk around the house in a supportive comfortable shoe! I really want them in every color!","33":"These are fun shoes, not meant to offer support or stability. They are on trend and comfortable after wearing hard sole shoes all day.","34":"Perfect house shoe! The fit is great and they are so comfortable. I would not recommend wearing them outside since the soles have open circles where things could get caught. But overall love the shoe! It\u2019s especially great for when I\u2019m at the sink doing dishes and I don\u2019t have to worry about water getting on them.","35":"i never write reviews but this was so good i had to leave one. these slippers make walking enjoyable. they are sooo comfortable and make me feel like i\u2019m walking on literal clouds. i\u2019m obsessed with them!","36":"These are fantastic slippers! I wear them EVERYWHERE!! The are so bouncy and comfortable! I bought the same pair for my boyfriend and he loves them too! They also make great boat shoes and my sister is going to use hers as shower shoes at college. BUY THEM NOW","37":"I could not believe how comfy these were! I\u2019m a 7 and these fit amazing!! My sister told me not to leave these in the car or in the sun, as they will shrink. 10\/10","38":"I am a professional housekeeper and one of my customers showed me a pair she had purchased. I thought they were hideous! Then I tried them on! They are like walking on clouds or a gymnastics floor! They are comfortable, durable, and super easy to clean! I throw them in the washing machine with rags whenever they get a little dirty. I highly recommend them!","39":"These slides are the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on my feet! I\u2019m definitely going to be buying another pair in another color!! It actually feels like I am walking on pillows or clouds! I feel so supported as a 3rd trimester pregnant women who has been in need of shoes that are comfortable but shoes that also fit since my feet seem to be growing\/swelling in this summer heat. I couldn\u2019t be happier with this purchase! 10\/10!! You need to buy you some now especially if you are pregnant and in need of comfort for your feet! I am normally an 8 but in pregnancy I have been more of 8.5 so I got the 7.5-8.5 size and they fit me perfectly!","40":"I actually really like the look of these shoes and don\u2019t plan on returning them, but if you\u2019re looking for something extra flexible and comfortable\u2026I wouldn\u2019t go with this brand. The strap feels like it has hard plastic edges and rubs on the top of your foot.","41":"I work on my feet all day and couldn\u2019t stand walking on my hard wood floors at home. These are a life saver!! I\u2019ve tried other brands of the same style and these are by far the best quality and comfort! Recommending them to everyone I know.","42":"As advertised. The khaki color is good at hiding any tarnishes from wear and tear. I am a W 7.5\/8 and the 8 is much too big. I should have sized down to a 7!","43":"Love the cloudlike softness!  I have a lot of shoes and boots for different things and these are now my go to slip ons. Outside because of the height and the softness they may be somewhat unstable for uneven surfaces. But I plan to just wear them inside. I wear a 9 or 9.5 and the men's 9-10 size works well for me.","44":"At first I got disappointed with these slippers and wanted to return them because they felt loose on my feet, and I have wide feet. I was worried that I would not be able to keep my foot in a shoe. But i got busy and missed the due date for return. And Oh, boy, am I glad that I did. I wear them now all the time in the house. Even though they are wide, but by some mysterious force they stay put on my feet. They are super cushy, and it feels like walking on a cloud. I have a really bad neuropathy in my feet and sometimes have a hard time falling asleep, but now my neuropathy considerably diminished since i started to wear these puppies. Some nights I completely forget that I even have neuropathy. I am so happy with my purchase, thank you for making this product available.","45":"The size I received was 12.5 and I wear a 12.  It's just too small but very comfortable if it fit.  I wish I could get a larger size.  Looks like the sizes are smaller than posted.  Great product though.","46":"Wow. These are like walking with marshmallows strapped to your feet. So squishy. I bought them for travel, not sure how durable they'll be or how comfortable for a full day of walking, but I'm definitely going to be giving them a try! I am typically a 7.5 and got the 7.5-8.5 in White. They are just barely the right size, almost too small. I will definitely not be able to wear socks with them in the cooler months, so keep that in mind when you purchase. But definitely purchase!","47":"I purchased three of these type of sandals all from different brands to see which we liked. Ended up keeping all three but here\u2019s the rundown:Purchased- Bronax, Joomra, and CushionaireAll three are great. All are soft and cushy enough to be very comfortable. Personally I\u2019d go with Bronax but may depend on what you\u2019re using them for.Cushionair was the most \u201csturdy\u201d and I kept these as I\u2019ll be using the slides out of the house going to and from work where I keep \u201cwork\u201d shoes.  If you want to wear them around town I suggest cushionair or Bronax. Cushionair being the most sturdy (while still comfy and smooshy). Bronax are more cushy than Cushionair but still sturdy enough to wear out and about and forced to choose I would choose Bronax sized up. The Joomra are verrrrry cushy and the least sturdy. Great for walking around the house or run to take out the garbage but maybe too smooshy to go out and about in them consistently.Bronax and Joomra ran slightly small. I usually wear a womens 8, sometimes 7.5 and ordered what would be an 8 in all brands. Bronax and Joomra did technically fit but with no room for error. They fit my kid  perfectly who wears a 7 womens.As I said, we actually liked all of them and I ended up keeping one and 2 of my kids ended up taking the other pairs as they liked them that much.","48":"I purchased these slides because I didn\u2019t want to spend a ton of money on Yeezy slides. I purchased my regular size 11, and the fit was perfect. The green was vibrant and the shoe is soft. And OMG your feet floats in them. My son and husband tried them on and they couldn\u2019t believe how comfy they are!  We had a few laughable moments. Great inexpensive purchase for sure!","49":"This is an amazingly comfortable shoe. Every person who has worn them has commented on how soft and comfortable they are. It\u2019s like walking on a cloud. My only complaint is the durability. Because of the material they did start to rip after 2 months. I did wear them almost everyday so I would definitely recommend. Just don\u2019t be surprised if they don\u2019t last forever","50":"They are super comfy but the olive green color in person is definitely more of a beige\/tan with some olive green undertones. Definitely not as nice of a color as I was hoping for, probably would have chosen differently had the image been correct.","51":"You have to get the sizing down better.  A women\u2019s 7\/8 was more like a 9\/10!","52":"I ordered true to size and at first I thought they were too small. The directions said to use a hair dryer on them to loosen them up. I just left them out in the sun for 10 mins and got a nice, snug, form fit. It's the first pair of slides I feel I could go running in, they stay on your feet! They're made from the same type material as crocs, I believe. Soft, comfortable footbed. If they stand up to regular wear, I'll give 'em a fifth star.","53":"I wanted these so bad, but they run small. Normally a 7.5, so I ordered the 7\/8 and spooks have sized up. Otherwise obsessed.","54":"Bought for husband. He left them outside on patio & they shrank in the sun. They no longer fit. He didn\u2019t like them. I got pillow slides in pink & mine stretch out after several months so now are too big.","55":"I really like this slide if the are only meant for walking around the house or to the store for a quick trip. However do not wear them as regular slide for hour and hours because your feet will kill you afterwards","56":"I love how cushioned these are! It feels like walking on a cloud and have great support. I can't wait to buy a variety of colors! Easy to wash off as well if you happen to get them dirty.","57":"I suffer from plantar fasciitis and these help with the pain . I have tried many slippers\/ shoes that are slip on after being on my feet all day at work and these truely help . I would wear them to work if I could . So comfortable I highly recommend them.","58":"I bought into the TikTok hype and got these shoes on Prime Day. They\u2019re wildly not cute and everyone has questioned me buying them, but I regret nothing. I\u2019ve worn them every day at home since I got them. Perfect summer house shoes. They seem a bit clunky at first. I wear an 8.5\/9 so I bought the 9\/10 thinking the smaller size would be too small. Probably could\u2019ve gone either way but happy with the larger size","59":"These shoes are like walking on clouds.  Larger than I expected but I love them. They are really to wear while cooking and washing dishes.  They reduce the pressure on my low back.  I highly recommend.","60":"I read reviews for multiple different slippers similar to these on Amazon and decided to try these. I\u2019m so happy I did! I have nerve pain in my feet, and these give me great relief! The soles are so thick and airy, like standing on a cloud. I\u2019m going to buy a pair to wear outside the house for running around and chores. EXCELLENT buy!","61":"So glad the two I bought (white and red) are sooo comfy and cloud like. I had gone with another company and had to send them back because they were either too big or too hard on my feet. I have plantar fasciitis and these help so much, so I have to make sure they are the soft ones! Will order in two more colors.","62":"I can\u2019t stress how comfortable these shoes are.  It\u2019s comfortable for my wife who is only 90 lbs, and also comfortable for me, who is 200 lbs.  I had plantar fasciitis, the shoe resolved the issue for me in a week.  My wife has torn meniscus, it\u2019s also comfortable for her.  I will not buy any other brands from now on.","63":"I\u2019m going to be totally honest upfront and tell you that these are some ugly ugly shoes. My husband says they remind him of the texture of circus peanuts\u2026 You remember that foamy candy from when we were kids?  He\u2019s right.However, these are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on my feet. I feel like I\u2019m walking on one of those stress mats\u2026 Like the ones you might put in front of your kitchen sink? Truly soft and comfortable and my plantar fasciitis does not act up at all when wearing them.  I live in the south, and it\u2019s currently July, so there is definitely some sweat that builds underneath the strap, but I will take a little bit of sweat for my feet to be this comfortable.  Definitely going to but another pair - and probably in an obnoxious color - since they are so ugly anyway.  Buy a pair - you won\u2019t regret it(unless you are a fashionista)!","64":"These are insanely comfy & fit fairly well for a generalized size shoe. They aren\u2019t \u201ccloud-like\u201d as some reviewers have said, but they are fairly close. When I first put them on I thought I would be returning them because they felt like they might slide off due to my toe area being a bit small for the fit of the strap, but after walking around in them for a few minutes I decided they were keepers. I wore them the entire rest of the day and almost forgot I was wearing shoes. My only critique upon initial experience is that if you have narrow feet these may not be for you; I have semi-wide feet and they still felt a bit loose at first, although they did stay put fairly well even with that feeling.","65":"I am on my feet all day. I suffered an ankle injury a few years ago, so I sometimes wear a brace to alleviate the pain. These slides are so cushiony yet supportive that the pain is diminished because I no longer over-compensate (my gait) in order to protect the ankle. In other words, I am walking \u201cnormally\u201d again because of the comfort and support of this slides.My sister, who has experienced severe knee pain, tried mine on during her last visit and fell in love with them! I gave her one of my pair and then sent her another pair as a gift.I highly recommend these slides!","66":"A teacher I work with told me about these...and I'm SO THANKFUL she did! I have plantar fasciitis, and being on my feet all day can be excruciating.  These sandals are like walking with two pillows tied to my feet! I loved them so much, I ordered two more pairs. I normally wear a 7.5, and ordered the 7.5-8.5 and they fit perfectly.","67":"I use a 7 1\/2 to 8 shoe size and bought the 7 1\/2 to 8 1\/2 and they fit small.  They do feel wonderful, so cushiony and soft but I realized it has no arch support.  I recommend these if lack of arch support is not an issue.  Size up.","68":"They\u2019re just a soft and comfortable as everyone has been saying! So glad I finally got them and didn\u2019t buy the similar ones I saw in the store, those were way too hard.","69":"Needed something soft yet supportive I could wear around the house at the end of a long day on my feet. I saw a bunch of ads for these but I was skeptical so I read tons of reviews first and chose an Amazon seller that sold a better brand (decided upon after reading reviews) and promised a short shipping time. I'm glad I made the purchase. They're just as comfortable as I expected. I just hope they hold up better than memory foam slides\/slippers. As others have said, size does run a little small, so keep that in mind when ordering.","70":"Obsessed with these. Haven\u2019t taken them off since I bought them. They are surprisingly cute for how comfy they are and they are insanely comfy. The strap was a little loose so I did the hairdryer thing and they literally formed to my feet, it was amazing","71":"It's like walking on an anti-fatigue mat. Reduces the impact when walking on hard surfaces like linoleum .","72":"I walk a lot at work and once I make it home these slide are amazing to allow my feet to have the comfort I need to finish up the evening with the busy house work.","73":"Are they ugly, sort of but no as ugly as crocs!!!  Are they comfortable 100%!  Love so much bought a pair for my company coming and another for myself.","74":"I ordered these as a gift for my Mother. She\u2019s a size 6-6.5 so I ordered that size, but they\u2019re quite a bit bigger than that. Not only are they too long, but also too wide. I\u2019m returning them tomorrow, sadly. The size smaller I ordered for myself had the same issue. I had her try those on but they didn\u2019t fit her either. Very disappointing.","75":"I absolutely loved these sandals. Wore them all the time. However working in the garden with these shoes is not recommended. After I was done watering and was walking away on cement and all of a sudden went flying and landed on both knees. Nothing broke. So please be careful","76":"Overall I really like these. They were nice to have after my back surgery. I think I wore them too much and they started rubbing the sides of my feet raw. Still, they are nice for taking the dog out or brief use.","77":"Would have returned but had thrown the packing down the garbage shoot before trying on","78":"So they\u2019re not the prettiest. Got them in white. And they gave me blisters the first day. But now that I\u2019ve worn them for months, I love them!!! They\u2019re my all time favorite shoes and they are durable and I travel with them and wear them at the beach, at home, etc. I wash them with soap in the sink and they\u2019re just sooooooooo comfortable. So comfy!!!!!!! Best shoes ever. Love them","79":"3.5 stars. Good quality, but the strap that goes over my foot is way too big so my feet slip out. This isn\u2019t a sizing issue because my feet fit perfectly to the sole, it\u2019s just the strap that\u2019s too large","80":"These slides are comfy and cushiony for around my home and hard ceramic floor tiles. The width is a bit too wide. I tried the hair dryer trick for a more snug fit but it didn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t mind as they are just house slippers for me. I ordered yellow & The color is nice too.","81":"I normally wear size 13 in shoes like Nike and New Balance. My true size is US12.5 though, so I ordered the mens 11.5-12.5. Not surprisingly, it fits like a size 12. It should be called size 12, not size 11.5-12.5 because shoe size needs to be exact. I can wear them but they are a half size shorter than I would prefer. The width is fine.","82":"I usually wear an 8 but I could have sized up in these. They are super comfortable and help my feed tremendously while 8 mo pregnant. Also using these as my slippers for the hospital bc they are so comfy!","83":"Buy them. YOU WON\u2019T REGRET IT. Could make a great gift. I have hard floors and can\u2019t feel them at all under these shoes. I might need an outdoor pair. My slides feel like cardboard compared to these. CAN NOT RECOMMEND THESE ENOUGH. Comfiest shoes you might ever try on.","84":"These slides are super soft and a tiny bit smaller than expected.  I wouldn't say they offer support as I feel like I'm going to fall backward sometimes when wearing them.  I am keeping them to wear around the house on my hardwood floors.  I ordered an identical pair in a different color from another company, and they are a size too small.","85":"Loved the shoes until they caught on fire & my foot almost burnt off. My shoes completely melted when I was at a bonfire. I know it hasn\u2019t been a month yet is there anyway I can get sent a new pair. I can show pictures of the shoes if needed to show proof.","86":"They are so comfortable, I am blown away. I really am in love with them. I\u2019d buy a second pair just to keep my bottoms from getting dirty! \ud83d\ude02A must buy!","87":"Ordered a few colors and the comfort really depends on the color.  Not sure why.  But, would I buy them again, yes.","88":"These slippers are super comfy. My feet ached if I had to stand for long hours. Since using these slippers, pain is so much better. I have kind of flat feet and have to wear supportive shoes all the time","89":"So comfortable, wear them out or just around the house. They look good ! I would not recommend them for any long distances, like walking around the mall all day. But overall five stars","90":"The fact that you can use your blow dryer and mold these things to your feet is amazing! I have severe plantar fasciitis and these are the only things that don't make my feet hurt. They are not the cutest things in the world but at this point it's about functionality to me and these are a 10 out of 10. I have 2 pairs now black and pink.","91":"I\u2019m in my feet a lot around the the house cooking and cleaning. I had two or three different house shoes for summer but my back hurt so much. I did a lot of research and then ordered these. I couldn\u2019t be happier. Lots of support and they fit perfectly","92":"I don't get up from the bed until I have these on my feet. They help me walk so much. I have a tumor in my hip and arthritis in my knee and ankle from injuries and surgeries. It alleviates me from a 10\/10 pain to 6\/10!","93":"Even though they look like prison shower shoes, they are BY FAR the most comfortable footwear I\u2019ve ever had. I highly recommend to anyone with plantar fasciitis, fallen arches, or any other foot issue. 10\/10 would recommend \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc","94":"They cool.they make alot of noise when u walk and really do if u put them on out the shower","95":"I\u2019ve tried so many different slippers but these are by far the best ones I\u2019ve ever worn!! It feels like stepping on clouds, there\u2019s a little bounce every time your foot hits the floor. It softens the impact a lot, even when I\u2019m exercising and jumping on my hardwood floors, I wear these slippers and my feet don\u2019t hurt at all :D highly recommend, I\u2019ll be buying another pair for outside use","96":"I am of Asian pacific descent and my feet are pretty wide.  It\u2019s hard to find slippers like this that fit.  I wear about a 10\/10.5 and the 10\u2019s were great!After a long day and foot pain I totally can relax in these bad boys.","97":"Most comfortable shoe I\u2019ve owned other than my Brooks. Foot doesn\u2019t slip back & forth. Good grip. Stylish. Can wear all day. Sizing was a little weird with it being a size range instead one specific size. I\u2019m usually a size 8.5 or 9 in some shoes. I went with 7.5-8.5 range and they worked for me! If you want a little more space I would suggest to size up, though. Love so much I now have 4 pair!!! Amazing shoe.","98":"They\u2019re super comfy and very nice looking.The fit is just a tad small but nothing that bothers me.","99":"These are exceptionally comfortable initially when you put them on. They really do feel like clouds on your feet. The one downside, that is so huge I will not purchase any additional, and I will advise people against them\u2026 They should have been designed with graduated thickness of the soul. If it was a little bit of a thinner soul in the front by the toes and slowly became thicker as it got to the heel it would be a much better design. The reasoning behind my statement \u2013 \u2013 as an adult, typically we put most of our weight on our heel as we walk. When that happens in these shoes, you end up with your heel in a negative position. The weight on our heel crushes the softness of the soul but the weight in the toes is not as significant so your toes end up higher than your heel. Unless you have a condition where you need your heel in a negative position, these will just cause your problems in the long run.Maybe they will redesign them, because I was very sad that this was the case. They really are soft and comfortable but have a serious design flaw.","100":"So cute and so so so comfortable! I feel like these shoes go with everything. The color was as pictured and I ordered the same size I would in any other shoe and it was perfect.","101":"First time ever leaving a review and I feel like this deserved one! Better than expected. So comfy. My feet have never felt better in these. Definitely buying more colors. The pink are so pretty!! Buy them!!","102":"I cannot say enough about these shoes. They are incredibly soft, comfortable and durable. I wore them on vacation and they withstood the pool, airport, and walking for miles.","103":"I am very happy with these slippers! They\u2019re very comfortable, lots of arch support and also affordable! I bought them to lessen my back pain caused by prolonged standing in the kitchen and they\u2019re so worth it. I ended buying three more for my family.","104":"I have plantar fasciitis and was looking for a comfortable shoe to wear around the house and on brief errands. I ordered the first pair in my normal size and they were way too small. So, I ordered another pair the next size up. They were so wide I walked right out of them! Love the idea of this shoe and am sad I couldn\u2019t get the right fit. They are super soft and cushiony, but I just couldn\u2019t seem to get the appropriate size.","105":"My daughter-in-law and I have purchased several pair of these shoes. We love them. Their comfortable. The only problem you cannot leave them out in the heat. She left her black shoes in her car. Of course it is summer and it gets very hot in a car. Well her shoes shrank about 2 sizes.  In the picture it shows how much they did shrink. The shoes were purchased at the same time and of the same size. Other than the shrinking in heat they are worth the buy.","106":"Bought these because a couple of friends got these and we\u2019re raving over how comfy these are.  I wouldn\u2019t wear them long distance walking though.  I wore them on a 4 hour drive and first time my ankle wasn\u2019t sore.  The cushion underneath shields you from pressure with your foot.  I may just buy more colors!  For reference, I bought the 7.5-8.5 and I\u2019m a true 8.5 with wide feet and the pic will show you how the fit is.  It cradles my foot.  My daughter has the next size up and they are a bit big.  Mine are more fitted.  You can go either way.  Get them!  So worth the price!","107":"While these slides make your feet look like you\u2019re walking on bricks, the comfort I get from them outweighs that. In the house, they are hugely comfortable with plenty of cushioning under my feet. I\u2019ve even worn them out in the yard and into the woods behind my house and they supported me somewhat. I wore them out to the grocery store one day because I just didn\u2019t want to take them off! But my vanity has prohibited me from doing that again. For me, they are great house shoes and provide the cushioning my arthritic feet need.","108":"Great for after a shower.  I bought these shoes to put on right after I get out of the shower.  I was getting worried about slipping because of wet feet.  Great gripping on the floor.  Hugs my foot nicely.  Actually pretty comfortable.","109":"I followed directions on first time wear. I work from home, but am on my feet a lot throughout the house. I was really hoping they were as comfortable as others had stated, but they are just okay. Not terrible, but not amazing either. Just okay! It could just be my feet, who knows!","110":"These are (ugly but) SO comfortable. I have foot pain a lot, including heel spurs, and these alleviate the pain. I\u2019m lay only concern is that I may roll my ankle due to the sole height.","111":"I would suggest you order up in size, does fit a bit small","112":"Like most of the other reviewers I live with plantar fasciitis, this slippers have made walking in my house such a dream. I have steps in my home and it was murder on my feet but now I'm gliding up and down the steps pain free! Since I've received them I've not been more then 10 ft away. I'm so happy to have found this, I am going to buy more so I never run out.","113":"Got here on time super fast. Wow! The feeling you get when walking feelsLike walking on the clouds. Thats the best way i can describe it. Super soft and comfy.","114":"These shoes are wide but they are comfy and soft. I ordered these and then ordered crocs and in my opinion these are way more comfy then crocs. They do run a little big","115":"They came in today and I haven\u2019t taken them off. I hate wearing shoes inside or even when I\u2019m sitting and relaxing. I\u2019ve been on my feet most of the day organizing and doing things around the house and I am in love with the comfort. Came as expected. Fits just right. And truly the best thing I\u2019ve gotten this summer.","116":"The item is great, and it worked as expected, the fit is perfect. I would recommend it.","117":"I wear an 11, sometimes a 10.5. I ordered my usual size and they are a little bit too short. May return for the next size up.","118":"Sizing is off","119":"These are so comfy and squishy!! I love how soft they are and still give you reasonable support. It's nice that they are true to size. I'll have to get another pair or two!","120":"Super comfy!","121":"i really like these for walking around the house. the hard floors were killing my heels.these are fantastic for that. i normally wear woman's 7-7.5 (37-38) and have narrow feet. i ordered what the size chart said for a 240mm foot and they are exactly perfect","122":"These are very comfortable and supportive on the feet especially when standing cooking or cleaning.  Only negative is your feet do sawat because of the material.  Not breathable at the portion of the slipper that is around the top of foot.  Can wear socks.","123":"I\u2019ve seen a lot of people wearing these so i had to get them since I heard they are super comfortable and it\u2019s so true. They top my favorite sandals i used to wear before i bought  these. The only thing I don\u2019t like about them is they\u2019re not sweatproof and they can get kinda dirty. But because they\u2019re like rubber material they wash easily. Other than that they are excellent so far","124":"I ordered 2 pairs of these slippers as house shoes. One for my husband and one for me. My husband\u2019s pair fit well and he says they are really comfy. I consistently where a size 8, but the 7.5-8.5 was too small. I returned mine.He loves them and I\u2019m jealous mine didn\u2019t work out. Hopefully the sizing will improve.","125":"I read somewhere that these were originally intended for post workout and they would be perfect for that. They feel like you\u2019re walking on the mattress topper of shoes. We take our shoes off at our house but walking around barefoot hurts my feet and back. I work from home so \u201cindoor shoes\u201d are worn more than 10 hours a day.  In the past I have worn shoes like  Nike or Adidas slides with Memory Foam, Birks or my favorite, OluKai flip flops. THIS SHOE IS NOT THAT.While it has a thick cushiony rubber sole, there is no arch support (see picture below). The material is similar to a Croc, but these shoes are a slide so that material is tighter around your foot than a Croc, so you might not appreciate the way it feels around your skin.I bought these after seeing them on the Today Show and they were \u201ccute\u201d and \u201cso comfortable you can wear them all day\u201d. If you need to wear them for comfort all day you may be disappointed. These are perfect shoes to throw on after your take your athletic shoes off at the gym. (As intended)","126":"I\u2019ve been wearing these all summer.  For short trips to stores. So comfortable that I got another pair for my friends.","127":"These sandals are so comfy. I\u2019m a 7.5-8 shoe size and ordered the 7.5-8.5 options. They\u2019re roomy, but stay on my feet. However, DO NOT leave them in the sun. They will shrink up. I forgot them outside for 1 day and now I\u2019m heel hangs off the back slightly and they rub on the top of my foot. Lesson learned and will be ordering a new pair.","128":"These shoes are really squishy!  It's like walking in sand.  The strap on the left foot rubs my toes a bit if I wear them too long, but I have weird toes that stick up a little.  It's slightly irritating, but not a big deal.  I wear them around the house and in the yard for gardening.  They are generally pretty comfy & good for standing.  They are like an extra thick shoe version of those mats people use for standing at the kitchen sink.  Haven't had them long, but so far so good.  Seem durable, too.","129":"but when I started to walk in them they felt so good I decided to keep them. Not elegant for women with narrow feet but the foot massage makes totally up for that.","130":"These sandals are great for walking around the house, heading out to run errands, or spending the day by the pool. They are incredibly soft and very trendy. While the color isn't ideal. They can be a bit clunky, but I believe that is necessary to provide the support and comfort that they achieve. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone.","131":"Best indoor home sandles I have ever worn. They\u2019re so soft and comfortable","132":"Size up","133":"I\u2019m a waitress in downtown Chicago and sometimes I pull 13+ our days.  These are all I wanna think about when I\u2019m not working.  I bought in several colors.  They actually look like sandals that you would get in any penitentiary in the USA but who cares when ur throbbing feet feel cozy!","134":"This slide is truly like walking on a cloud. I am so pleasantly surprised and very happy with my purchase!","135":"My sister bought something similar but hers were comfier and came in a nice travel bag for less money.  These started to hurt the side of my big toe so I gave them to my daughter.  They run kind of big.","136":"Beige ones were my first pair. These are so nice so I got more.","137":"Ignore the dog hair but go up a size!","138":"Bought these for my 12 year daughter.  She absolutely loves!! She said they are the most comfortable slides she has owned.  Highly recommend for any age","139":"Got these cute sandals to wear around the house when I don\u2019t feel like wearing slippers. These are the most comfortable shoes I own. They will certainly be worn more then around the house. Literally feels like you are walking around on a mattress soft top. So comfortable and run true to size! Just get them!","140":"My house has all tile floors and my feet were killing me. I bought these to wear around the house and they are perfect. It\u2019s like walking on a cloud!","141":"love these shoes!! I have so many feet issues, everything but crocs usually bother, but these are actually better than crocs! I am so glad I bought these. I wear them around the house and feel like I'm walking on clouds. great arch support too.","142":"Love these shoes, actually have 3 pairs. What I found out yesterday was, they are very hazardous when your foot and shoe are wet. I was getting out of my above ground pool, slid my wet feet into my dry sandals, took my first step down to the next level step on stairs and vroom, my foot slid all the way out of the front of the shoe and I almost lost my balance (about 3' from ground). It took me more than 20 minutes to shove, push, cajole, scream, and finally out of exasperation, almost cut it off which of course would have ruined the shoes. Finally wedging a shoe horn between the top of the foot and the shoe, I was able to remove it from around my leg. My leg is a little bruisedbut ok. The top of the sandal, due I believe to the length of time on my leg, is now totally stretched out too large too wear safely. I will be returning but requesting a replacement pair. I love these shoes and learned a valuable lesson; dangerous when wet. I have slipped walking when I've hosed dirt off my shoes and feet after gardening. I walk slowly on the concrete if my feet are wet, no problems. This was an unusual and unfortunate incident, very laughable now actually. So, with caution when wet, I do recommend these shoes.","143":"Very comfy but I wear 7.5 so I bought an 8.  Next time I will try a size 7.","144":"You 'almost' get what you pay for.Pros:- Soft- Considerable as a gift- Accurate sizeCons:- Insides of slippers are not what you're used to have.- Pricey.- Material doesn't look very promising in the long run.","145":"I grabbed these out of the mailbox earlier today and slid my feet into them. It was an incredible moment of cushiony softness! A few hours later, I am still amazed how comfy they are, but they do make my feet feel a bit\u2026.sweaty \ud83d\ude2cI can\u2019t speak to the durability since I just got them but if I don\u2019t come back and update this, y\u2019all can assume they\u2019re still holding together.","146":"If in doubt, order a size up. They run about 1 to 1.5 sizes small.","147":"Muy comodas, perfectas para la casa.","148":"I have a couple different things wrong with my foot.  There really isn't a arch support, but the are pretty comfortable . I wouldn't suggest wearing them for a prolonged period of time.","149":"I am currently on bed rest but wanted something comfortable to wear around the house. They are so comfortable all around, fit perfectly. Highly recommend!","150":"Sizing is a little off (smaller)","151":"These are the best slides I\u2019ve ever owned! SIZE DOWN if your on the fence with sizes. They definitely run big","152":"There was nothing to not like . Picture as advertised .The only reason that I returned thy were a little too wide for my narrow feet.","153":"I know everyone loves to wear these outside but I only wear these indoors. Due to the thickness of the sole it took me a little time to adjust to the cushioney feeling lol. It fits perfect but because of the grooves for your toes I couldn\u2019t size up.","154":"Decided to buy some since I kept seeing them everywhere. I bought them with low expectations in mind however when I received them I was completely shocked. They are not the most cute looking shoes I've had but they are so comfortable. Bought them 7.5-8 considering I'm 7.5 most of the time. They fit perfectly with a little room behind. They are so comfortable I rave about them anytime I can.","155":"Normally wear size 8 so I ordered the size 7.5-8.5 slides and as you can see in the photo they are too small.","156":"I have a size 6.5 foot and I ordered the size 6-7. If my feet were any bigger they'd be too small, so I believe these run small.  Other than that, I really like them a lot.  The red ones are as shown, a dark red.  I did not want bright red, so was happy about this. They are very, very comfortable.","157":"Great for swollen feet during pregnancy. They are on wide and so comfortable. I would recommend","158":"I bought these when I first moved into our new home which had hardwood floors. I have arthritis and was looking for slippers to stop my feet from hurting but orthopedic shoes are so expensive. These were super comfortable and inexpensive. I\u2019ve had them for over a year and have had zero signs of wear. Great purchase!","159":"Bought these as a gift for my girlfriend and she loved them, thick cushion and comfortable","160":"This is arguably the best purchase I\u2019ve made. It all started when I tried on my friends roommates pair. I felt like I was walking on clouds. These shoes are perfect for all settings. I wear them to class, work, the beach, pool, grocery store, you name it. Have to take the dogs out (literally and metaphorically) slip on these. I hit legs in them, added 10 lbs to my squat pr. My brother has a pair, I just bought some for my dad. About to have the whole family dripped out. Highly recommend purchasing to make your life better.","161":"Very comfortable. Feel like slippers. Great to throw on to run errands or go outside.","162":"Nice","163":"These shoes are very comfortable but sadly going to have to return. I\u2019m a 8.5 so got the one that was listed for that. It was too short but also pretty wide for my foot so going up was not going to work. Bummed as they feel like walking on clouds :(","164":"Shoes really do feel like im walking on a cloud. I walk everywhere in the house with them. I typically wear a Womens 11, and I got the size that has 11 in the range and it fit perfectly. My boyfriend got some but theyre a little too tight around the strap for his liking, but not enough to deny the comfortability. I suggest this shoe to anyone looking for a new shoe to wear around this house!","165":"I ware size 9 1\/2..ordered 10..my foot hangs off the back","166":"I wear a women\u2019s 10, so ordered that size. It was way too big. Reordered a 9 and it\u2019s a perfect fit. I ordered a light lavender and it perfectly matches my toe polish.","167":"Provides nice cushion for walking around on hard floors in our house- really like them!","168":"Loved these shoes until I left them outside on accident. They shrunk up afterwards.","169":"Super comfortable slippers! They provide support and insole cushion makes you feel like your walking on air. A must have!!","170":"They are surprisingly comfortable. My son really likes them.","171":"Very comfy and easily worn around the house or on a short walk. My foot does slide a bit, which there was a way to tighten the strap","172":"Fit perfectly and so comfortable I bought more for my daughters! Definitely recommend!","173":"I ordered pink, but received beige. These are comfy, but almost a little TOO soft? I think they are cute and comfy overall though. Just wish I got my pink ones!!!","174":"Perfect softness. I bought another brand the first time, but this one is softer. And right color!","175":"Love these so much I got them in a few different colors. And a couple of my young adult sons got them as well! They are super cute and stylish at the same time.The only negative I will mention is that I took them camping for over a week, after being in the lake and the sun etc for a few days\u2026. They shrunk about a half a size. I thought I was going crazy, until my son started complaining that his felt smaller. I\u2019d size up a half a size for sure if you are an outdoors person. Otherwise, if you just plan to wear them strictly for fashion and around the house etc, they are pretty true to size prior to the shrinking situation. \ud83e\udd28","176":"This is def my go to for when I want maximum comfort!","177":"Very comfy for the house. A bit unstable for out n\u2019 about","178":"Love these shoes they feel like you are walking on a cloud. They do run a half size big!","179":"I love these slides! Only complaint the top band is a bit too large for my foot. So I have to be careful when walking on uneven terrain.","180":"I wish I'd bought more colors. I plan on buying them as gifts for my friends \ud83d\ude0dThey're so so comfy..","181":"Son excelentes pero corren muy grandes","182":"This slippers are super comfortable great support and are very soft.  I'll be buying another pair very soon.","183":"I wear these around the house everyday! Exactly what I wanted\/needed! So soft and such a great price!","184":"I saw these on TikTok and when I first opened them, I audibly chuckled at the size of them. I bought a US 10, and they are quite wide and chunky. To the point where I wondered if I would look like I had clown shoes on when I wore them! Despite this, I actually don\u2019t hate the way they look on my feet and they are extremely comfortable. Nice neutral color. They will be a great summer errand\/boat\/house shoe!","185":"I was skeptical about these shoes but I am so glad I bought them. They hold up great for 8 hour shifts on a concrete floor!!","186":"Son muy c\u00f3modas y suaves me gustaron mucho","187":"True to size and super comfy I look forward to them every day","188":"I brought 4 already i LOVE IT its the best super comfy slippers ever.. wish theres a shoes for this","189":"So comfy. Love it. Will be buying more in other colors. I\u2019m a 7.5 woman and I got the size 7.5-8.5 womens.","190":"I have wide feet. Should have gotten a larger size but was afraid it would then be too long.","191":"Yes, they are comfortable.  Yes, they are ugly.","192":"Wear them all the time, in doors and out.Haven't had any foot pain since I started wearing them!!!","193":"What a comfortable pair of sandals. Like walking on \u201cClouds\u201d","194":"I absolutely love these slides. I've had my feet in the more expensive slides and they don't compare to these at all. These are the most comfortable slides I have ever owned. Easy to walk with on any terrain. My knees felt no pain standing in a very long line with these on. Get them now.","195":"I could not love these more, although I would have chosen the next size up as I'm a 7.5 and my feet JUST fit in these, but OMG they are fabulous!!  Like walking on marshmallows \ud83e\udd70  soooo soft!","196":"I love these around the house! So comfy! They do run large, especially in width\u2014I ordered a size down.","197":"They were a bit of a small fit so maybe size up one but I like them a lot !","198":"I like the Support, and Color. Love this Show.","199":"Tried these on with socks at first and they were a little tight, but took the socks off and it fit like a glove.  I size at 12.5 mens so luckily I could fit into the largest size.  If you\u2019re a 13+ mens you might be out of luck. I wear these around the house and my only regret is I didn\u2019t have a second pair to wear outside.  Just ordered my second pair for that purpose.  Cant wait!","200":"Because my feet are so wide (EEE) this was not sufficient to fit with any comfort.  I should send it back, but am a little too lazy.  Alas, I still walk to my condo complex' swimming pool barefoot.  Not the product's fault, so I did not penalize it greatly.  Probably OK for the vast majority.  [Caveat Emptor.]","201":"I purchased the blush color and they\u2019re definitely not blush. More like a pukey green-brown. They are comfortable though.","202":"The slides are incredibly comfortable. I wear a size 9 and because the slides come in a blended size, I could have ordered a smaller size.  They\u2019re  cute enough to wear to a gathering but they will definitely get the most use at home while I\u2019m standing on my feet.","203":"S\u00faper c\u00f3modas y muy agradable el,poder usarlas sin cansarte","204":"Literally the headline - I never want to wear any other shoe. I hate having to go to nice or formal events because I can't wear these. They are the most comfortable things I own. I love them more than any shoe should be loved.","205":"I was concerned that these were \"knock-offs.\" They are the real deal! SUPER, super soft. ALMOST as soft as my OOFOS, but not quite. Obviously much cheaper than OOFOS. Great purchase.","206":"Me agrado mucho \ud83e\udd29","207":"Each pair of these Bronax sandals fits two sizes. I am size 6. I ordered size 6-7 because I had no other choice. I really wanted to have one of these sandals made of EVA rubber material. The sandals were too big for me, really big and made my feet look like duck feet, and my steps awkward. Everyone laughed at me when I wear them, kindly of course, but nevertherless. I kept them because I like the cushion for the sole of my feet. I surfed all amazon and none of the brands carries the one size per pair. Why are they doing this? It's like one size fits all. Maybe I will try to order a smaller size combination. Now, that may come too small, 4.5 to 5.5 when I am size 6. And I have to make sure they are returnable. They are returnable only depending on the size. So watch out for this too. Endless headache.","208":"I ordered one pair and the day they came and I tried them on I ordered a second pair. I have problems with my feet and these have been the most comfortable footwear ever and I have spent upwards of $100 for orthotic flip flops and these are more comfortable. So soft just like walking on a cloud. And I walk outside a lot. Then I bring them in and throw them in the sink , spray some Lysol cleaner and a rinse and they're just like new. Do yourself a favor. If you have foot problems order these.","209":"Great shoes! Size up\u2026","210":"Thick and bouncy material. Fits like a glove!","211":"Not supportive which I was expecting but very comfy.","212":"They are comfy, not much arch support but very comfy for just walking around at home.","213":"I bought these for my son to have something on his  feet when he\u2019s walking around his dorm.  He loved them!!","214":"I legit use these slip-on every day. It's very comfortable and easy to put on.","215":"having flat feet, it personally gives me a lot of comfort and support. it\u2019s softer than expected compared to other sandals\/flip flops I\u2019ve had. I bought my mom a pair as well and she loves them. I am a size 5 1\/2 women so it was a little bigger on me even choosing the smallest size. Still worth the purchase.","216":"First of all, I love the fact that they have so much cushion that my feet don\u2019t touch the floor at all (I have carpet in my apartment and hated when I would feel it touching my feet).I would say though, I used it without washing\/cleaning it the first 2 days and later noticed I had a rash on the top of my foot. I would highly advise to clean it before using it. I wiped it with Clorox wipes and let it dry for a few hours, used it next day and I\u2019ve been fine since.I\u2019ve read other reviews saying they feel like walking on clouds, in my opinion, it does not feel like it, but they are not hard, and they are pretty comfortable nonetheless.","217":"I\u2019ve owned plenty of sliders from Adidas to Hunter to Nike.  These by far are the most comfortable.  You won\u2019t regret your purchase.","218":"I was looking for something to wear around the house. Not wanting to spend an arm and a leg to get a comfortable slipper, I tried these. I am happy with my choice. Other slippers tend to wear out in a week. I have been wearing these and they are comfortable and have yet to feel overused.","219":"Since getting a standing desk over the pandemic, I've been searching for a slipper that I could stand for several hours in. I tried memory foam slippers, which flattened out within 3 months. I've tried a pair of clean sneakers (we are a no shoes household) but I kept mixing them up with my regular sneakers and wearing them outside and getting them dirty. Also, I wanted the flexibility of being able to take off shoes\/slippers quickly while sitting. These are perfect! Cushy, supportive, soft. I have an anti-fatigue mat, and even when I don't use it, these slippers are more than enough. I've had these for 2 months now. I will update in a couple of months, hopefully these last.","220":"True to size. I wear a 6.5 women's, so I got size 6-7 in women and my feet fit inside the shoes' foot bed well. Very cushiony. I've only worn them inside the house so far, but they sure give me comfort on hard tile floors. So comfortable and lightweight, I even bought some for my sons for their college dorms. I bought some for my elderly parents, who have slender and bony feet, to wear around the house too.","221":"Most comfortable slide I have ever bought!","222":"I ordered \"lemon yellow\" but find the color to appear muted\/faded. Comfortable but the top is still feeling a little big, a gap between the top of my foot and the top \"band\"; however, I'll adjust! Almost better than being barefooted!","223":"I ordered a size up before this pair and they were HUGE. The other reviews lied! I then ordered these my normal size, fit perfect. They are so comfy, so cute. Worth the buy!","224":"Theyre extremely comfortable, but I expected arch support which they did not have but other than that theyre great","225":"I got these for shower shoes for my dorm. I absolutely love them they fit perfectly and are so comfortable. I definitely recommend these and they could be use as slides too since they are so comfortable.","226":"Don\u2019t leave these outside or in the car because mine shrunk! I went into a store for two hours and left these in the passenger seat. I came back to put them on and they didn\u2019t fit. \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd74","227":"Very Cushiony I\u2019m glad I got them for my wife they help her a lot she has rheumatoid arthritis and her feet needed these","228":"I love them,they are so comfortable","229":"I absolutely love theses cloud slides.  I wasn't sure if I liked the style\/look of them, but after getting them on my feet they aren't too bad looking and the comfort makes up for the look. I love them so much I am going to order another pair to wear in the house.","230":"10\/10 Amazing comfort. Just a little big.","231":"I wear a sz 6. Ordered the smaller sz and still a bit large. Order FULL sz down","232":"I\u2019m glad I read the reviews, I\u2019m an 8.5 and I went with a 9-10 and they fit perfectly. Very comfortable","233":"love this product! i gave it 4 stars only because i ordered my usual size and it was way too small once i got the next size they fit perfect!","234":"Perfect fit and so comfy","235":"I love how comfy and supportive these slippers are. I will be ordering more!","236":"I love them I have RA so I wear them for everything","237":"Wicked comfy. I had my husband try them on. His response was \u201c these are great. I feel like I just stepped in dog poop \u201c. Not sure what kind of a compliment that is or if I should be concerned","238":"Super comfortable, but the sizes are weird. Mine are too big, bug going down they are too small. That\u2019s my only complaint","239":"In car for one day they shrunk 2 sizes","240":"Super soft but very wide order 1 size down  just in case. If you have a wide foot then order reg size.","241":"love these but after 1 week they got really squeaky and they arent went and i havent walked outside with them yet. but overall 4\/10","242":"I ordered the light brown pair, men's size 10. When I received them, they were packaged neatly. Absolutely love and adore the color. The slides were way too large. I would have to wear them with very thick winter socks for them fit and these are definitely a summer slipper. I easily fixed the fit by putting them in the dishwasher, top rack, for one normal cycle and the heat shrunk them perfectly and they fit like a glove. I will probably order two more pairs as back ups! Very comfortable and I am pleased with my purchase.","243":"Very comfortable slide, I wear them around the house all the time","244":"These are exactly what I wanted. I have seen several people on social media wearing these, so I had to get me a pair (lol). I should have gone a 1\/2 size up. Pother than that these are pretty great! I will buy another color or two.","245":"These are so comfy and I wish I ordered them sooner!! I look forward to coming home and putting them on after work! I am 6.5 to size 7 and they fit perfectly!","246":"Love them  I can run around town with my feet and back not hurting","247":"Exceeded my expectations when it came to comfort! Feels like you\u2019re walking on clouds!! I got the size 6-7. I\u2019m a 7 and this are just a tad small but probably for better than the size up would. Love the color and they look so cute with every outfit!!","248":"I have planters fasciitis and was needing something to wear around in the house because I cannot go barefoot without my feet hurting so bad. Bought these shoes and they have worked out perfect for me. I have been wearing them as slippers.","249":"Haven\u2019t worn them a whole lot but they have been alright walking around the house in them.  They fit just right for me.","250":"Very comfy on my pregnant swollen feet! Would definitely buy again. I would size up half size.","251":"These are awesome to wear around my house, they're like walking on clouds. They're a tiny bit small.","252":"Was a gift","253":"I love these. They are comfortable,  and help with balance.","254":"I always wear a size 10 and the 9\/10 was too small for me. Otherwise the shoe arrived quickly and seems well made and comfortable. Just wish there were more size options.","255":"They looked great. Felt great. But once I started to use them I got blisters on the side of my big toe.","256":"They are very soft and confortable, love them","257":"My daughter loves these super comfortable and easy to clean","258":"My husband has issues with the bottom of his feet and he raved about how comfortable and soft these shoes are. Great fit and extremely comfy.","259":"They are supper comfortable, and very soft","260":"I wish the color matched better it\u2019s not as bright as I thought, but they are really comfy. They\u2019re pretty big on my feet","261":"I never write reviews but these are the most comfortable footwear I have ever worn. I wish they made sneakers with the same sole\/cushioning. The best!","262":"Look cute & fit but the lack of support leads to knee pain. Will be gifting","263":"I\u2019ve tried many types of orthotic sandals and slippers. These blow them all out of the water! The arch isn\u2019t too high and the sole isn\u2019t hard. I\u2019ve only had these a few days but what a difference they\u2019ve made for me. Originally I just wanted something to wear to the beach or pool. Now, I\u2019m wearing these all the time around the house. They are incredibly comfortable.","264":"These are my go to shoes to run errands or to the beach. Love them. So comfortable.","265":"Got these things for my poor swollen preggo feet! All of my other shoes were getting waaaay too tight. These things have lots of support and are very cushy. The rubber isn\u2019t the softest thing to wear, but it\u2019s great for just an around the house slide. My feet do swell to the point that sometimes the slides are a little snug, but I can always get them on enough to still wear. I\u2019m a true 7 and so I went with that size and it was perfect. Great product for the price.","266":"Loves this product will buy again, great value","267":"Love these! They\u2019re so comfy and Cute on. Nice to wear around the house or outside!","268":"Nice and comfortable, soft shoes. Feels like you\u2019re walking on foam. Perfect for long days out, at the beach, water park, pretty much anywhere!","269":"","270":"They are super comfortable and stylish!","271":"Love these- they were a gift from my daughter. I wear them around the house, and I like how \u201ccoushiony\u201d they are. They are a little big, even though she ordered my size, but not enough to make a big difference.","272":"Bought a pair for myself and my son out them on to take out trash, so he ask for his own pair. He loves them, says its like walking on air.","273":"Curled up in sun! Otherwise get shoes!","274":"A few of my friends  had these and I wanted to try. I read the other reviews and ordered a size up so the 7.5\/8 was what I ordered and I usually wear a 6\/6.5. A little big but not terrible. I'm sure if I ordered the right size they would be too small.They are very comfy! Do it buy them. I wear them, my pregnant friend wears them, my sister with back problems wears them. Do it for your self. You deserve it.","275":"These shoes have momentarily replaced my chaco\u2019s! I work 12 hr shifts in the hospital and wear Hokas. I\u2019ve found that on my days off when I run to the store, go shopping, stroll with my toddler outside\u2026these are my go to. They have the arch support I need and the marshmallow shortness that reminds me I\u2019m not at work \ud83d\ude02","276":"I wear a 7 to a 7.5 And ordered the 7.5 to 8.5 and they fit perfectly.  The most comfy shoes I have bought ..","277":"Love theseI have ever found So comfortable all day long","278":"I live with a lot of hip and lower back pain. So I use these shoes at home and I Love them !!!It\u2019s like walking on pillows \u2764\ufe0f","279":"I have problems with shoes ever since I could remember. I always get comfortable shoes. This sandals are so great. I ordered another one immediately \ud83d\ude09 Highly recommended \ud83d\udc4d","280":"Very nice and comfy just wish they were a tad bit softer","281":"Beat sleepers ever,my wife loves it.","282":"These cushioned slides are great at all times for runners when used as indoor slippers right after running or standing for prolonged periods of time when cooking, etc.  It has good support too but not tight.  It does the job as much as the ones sold at sporting goods stores that runners go to.","283":"No response","284":"I've been scouring Amazon to find a pair of these.  Most only seem to have small sizes.  I'm a size 13.  Size 12 in shoes is snug, but I can put it on.  Being that these are open toe, that's not an issue.  My knees immediately feel it once I put these on.","285":"Love these","286":"Very comfortable! I would buy them again.","287":"Very comfortable. No break in period needed.","288":"My son ordered these for himself. He loves them. Fit well, and comfortable. He's a size 12, and he ordered the biggest pair. They fit fine.","289":"I use these everywhere in the house and in the yard to water plants. Going\/coming from the gym, I love them!! It feels as if I\u2019m walking on clouds. They are a bit clunky, but the comfort makes up for it.","290":"They're super comfy but they run small, size up. Mine are just slightly too small.","291":"Only reason I\u2019m not giving it 5 stars is because the olive green color has a more yellow tone and I wished they were more similar to the color in the picture. I only wear them inside and they\u2019re so comfy so I can ignore that the color isn\u2019t what I expected. Would get another pair in another color cause they\u2019re sooo comfy and fit perfectly!","292":"Like walking on a cloud","293":"These are wonderful slides. So incredibly comfy. You can spend a whole day in them and ur feet will thank you. Just make sure you have a good pedicure cause your toes are on full display with these lol","294":"These shoes are comfortable and great price but I wish I would have sized down they are. A bit large for my foot.","295":"Comfy but massive! If you are on the lower end of the shoe range, I recommend sizing down a half soze","296":"Love the way they feel on my feet","297":"I bought 2 pairs and gifted them for my family, so comfortable for around the house n the summer!","298":"These are such comfortable slides! They are true to size and so cute. I love how cushioned they are.","299":"NOT THE TYPICAL BEDROOM SLIPPERS.. THESE SLIDES ARE WATER-PROOF & PERFECT FOR POOL-SIDE & BATHROOM. VERY WELL MADE WITH QUALITY MATERIAL, LATEX, MAINLY.","300":"Comfortable!","301":"So far I have purchased 4pair & given 1 pair away.Totally love these","302":"I loved these shoes until I stepped in something, hosed them off and let them dry in the sun. They shrunk 2 sizes and I couldn\u2019t wear again :(Great shoes just be careful of where you store them","303":"Very comfortable! Great price. Would definitely repurchase.","304":"I was looking for a supportive summer house slipper and heard cloud slip-ons were the ticket. I ordered this brand and and another one and liked the other slightly more. These fit tts (if maybe a little small) and I loved the deep brick red color but I found them to be a little too squishy when walking around without enough support. I suppose if you\u2019re looking for squish, this one would be the one to go with. I ended up keeping the cushionares (which were arguably slightly too long but mote supportive and secure for narrow feet).","305":"I like it \ud83d\udc95","306":"Haven't had slippers this nice and comfy from anywhere else before. People kept asking me if they were Yeezy slides.","307":"Got them for my mother in law. She loves them.","308":"So comfy and cute. I wear them all the time at home\u2026 to run errands\u2026 wherever! As a mama always on the go, these are easy to slip on and off and give me a comfy retreat after wearing heels for work. Fit true to size. I wear an 8 normally and these fit perfectly.","309":"I love this slippers, I would recommend them to anyone. Soft, very comfortable.","310":"I\u2019ve had these slides about 2 months now, & while they are without a doubt the comfiest shoes I\u2019ve ever worn\u2026. They shrunk about 2 sizes overnight while sitting in my car due to the heat. They\u2019re now mishapen, too small, and poorly fitting. Before this happened, I would\u2019ve rated 5 stars. Moral of the story\u2026 don\u2019t leave shoes anywhere warm.","311":"These are very comfortable. The length could be better for fit.","312":"I wear these everyday around the house and the pool! They are very comfortable and fit perfectly!","313":"Color is great- could wear everyday. Super fit and comfort!  Wearing these back and forth to yoga classes","314":"Na","315":"Super comfy. It really is like walking on a cloud.","316":"Love the shoes though this is my second pair because I left the first pair in the sun and they shrunk\u2026","317":"Great flip flops for house and pool! Love them!!!!! Won't tear easy or fall apart! Super cushion!!!!!","318":"It works indoor and outdoor both just fine\u2026.","319":"Ok, hear me out\u2026Are these cute? Nope.Will I (the person that regularly navigates life, unashamedly, with unwashed hair, no makeup, wearing an outfit with at least one stain that could possibly also be my pajamas) wear these out in public? Also no.But do I wear them every single day bc these are the most comfortable house slipper I\u2019ve ever owned (and I secretly love that I COULD wear them out if I wanted to)? Absolutely yes.Do your feet a favor and get these. Especially if you spend all day on your feet, love to go barefoot but have all hardwood and tile floors and don\u2019t allow outside shoes to be worn inside. These will change your life.(Now can we have a moment of silence for my youth bc I used the phrase \u201chouse slippers\u201d and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s all osteoporosis and hip replacements from here on out).","320":"Podiatrist recommended wearing some sort of shoe all the time to ease foot pain. Bought these to wear around the house. Alleviates all of my foot pain. Highly recommend over any slipper for comfort and support.","321":"I don't know how much I would wear in public - not to attractive..... lol.  But they are the most comfortable thing I've ever had on my foot.... And a great buy","322":"","323":"Better than I could have imagined! They fit like a glove and are the most comfortable!!","324":"These are just as comfy as I imagined, however I will probably just use strictly as house shoes because there is no support!!!! But great option to have around the house, they are a bit of an odd fit but they still work.","325":"Needed some comfy house slippers and these did the trick! Love them so much!!","326":"I didn't like that they weren't true to size","327":"There super comfortable ...","328":"Could not have been happier!","329":"Comfort","330":"The color options were limited for the size that was purchased. Should have returned but suffered through it.","331":"Easy to clean.Best cushion ever.My husband says my feet look good while wearing.???Lots of colors to choose from","332":"Theses slides are great! I bought them for my husband. He really didn\u2019t think much about them till he tried them on. Now he won\u2019t take them off!! He says they are just so comfortable.","333":"It's like wearing marshmallows on your feet! I wear them in the house, and I love them. Most comfortable slippers I've had.","334":"U will love walking on these \/ so lite , so comfy, looks great","335":"I love these , I bought 2 more different colors","336":"I decided to try these as indoor shoes, since I have Plantar Fasciitis and I need support for my feet at all times.  I was hopeful, as some reviews said they were helpful.  The squishiness is fun, but the slippers provide no support.  My feet swim in them.  I'm guessing they would be nice for someone without foot issues.  I'll stickwith my Crocs.","337":"At first these seemed huge- I have very petite feet. I was disappointed so I tried the blow dryer directions and they helped. THEN I tossed them in the dryer on delicate for 5 min and let them cool down and they are PERFECT! So coushy and feel like you are walking on clouds! I\u2019m a working mom of a toddler and an infant and these honestly feel like a self care item lol. I will be purchasing more and I have recommend to friends and family \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc","338":"Game changer for walking across sand at the beach.  They\u2019re a little wider than regular flip flops so it\u2019s much easier to walk in them.  My favorite new summer foot wear","339":"Not exact fit. Runs more like 8.5-9 size. Not 9-10 size.","340":"They say all sandles are about the same...WRONG!!! Comfortable sandles stay comfortable for what about 2 weeks thing I find everything I dislike about them usally it's the wearing them over a few hours how they tend to hurt ur feet. These are different the mold to ur feet process maybe over looked but it does wonders for that little spot right in the middle of ur foot thats always is the first to start hurting. And they don't deflate like the cheap foam one... if u know what I mean...all in all worth the 25 bucks","341":"Sandal is a bit wide but comfortable and supports my flat feet very well. However cushionnaire has a better bounce and comfortability","342":"I never take these shoes off.  They are the most comfortable pair of slides I have ever owned.  I am typically a size 10 and ordered an 11 I believe.  They are a little big, but honestly I like how they feel oversized. I want to get every color.","343":"These slides are super cute! love the dark brown color, and how they feel like your walking on clouds. After a few wears they really mold to your feet. I defiantly would buy in more colors","344":"I ordered these to take to the beach, and now they\u2019ve creeped in to my day to day wear.They are super comfy, stylish and feel like I\u2019m walking on clouds. Will definitely be buying more colours","345":"I love these slippers so very much! They really do feel like clouds. I just moved and have been super busy unpacking and organizing my new house. I've worn these slippers all day every day for a full week and my feet are so happy. I love that if they get a little dirty, I can just rinse them when I shower. SO GOOD! Get you some! You won't regret it. I wear a 5-5.5 in women's and the 4-5.5 size fits me perfectly. AND... I have super wide feet and there's plenty of space and no pinching or pressure.","346":"Like the comfort but big and no support","347":"I love these shoes!!  They are so comfortable, like walking on a pillow.  They stay on my feet, which is not always the case with shoes with no support around the heel.  I have trouble with arthritis and these are just great, even for me.","348":"I should\u2019ve bought a smaller size but love them otherwise!","349":"I wore this slides with everything in Cancun. They are so comfortable. If they get wet and your feet don\u2019t slide all over the place.","350":"super comfy shoes","351":"a teensy bit too big but i went a size up thinking they weren\u2019t going to fit, size 8 chose size 9.Very comfy and bouncy :)","352":"These slides are much needed after a long day of working on your feet. At first, I had to get used to the height, but aside from that my only issue is how much my feet sweat when wearing them. I saw someone else mention it, and after experiencing it myself, I can confirm that my feet do sweat more than usual when wearing them. Still very comfortable though.","353":"These shoes were very comfortable. Wish I could wear these to the office.","354":"Love them just make sure to get a size up since I usually run a size 6 and they were a little small for me. But overall they are amazing","355":"So darn comfy!!","356":"I love the shoe BUT I bought a 9 and it was a half size to small. Gave it to my 81\/2 friend lol","357":"Very highly recommend this slide!!!!! Just order one size smaller. Usually I wear size 6 for shoes, but for this slide, size 4-5 is perfect for me. Not hurting my beautify feet at all after a 3-mile walking at the beach. Really happy and ordered for more colors today. I have tried the cheaper one only $14 from another seller. Although the appearance\/color looks the same. However, it is very hard to walk and definitely will return the cheap version. So happy to find it.","358":"I love it","359":"I like them, but I have very narrow feet. My shoes need to be long enough to keep my toes from overhanging, but I need the upper tight enough to hug my foot so they will feel secure\u2026no option to adjust these. I could put packing material there.Also, the man-made material makes my soles sweat. I actually need socks to feel comfortable.","360":"These are great for the pool. They don\u2019t slip and dry super fast. Super comfortable around the house even. I really like them. The only negative is the size for me. I usually wear a 7.5 in shoes and I got the 7.5-8.5 size but feel they are small. I almost sent them back but they\u2019re just at the cusp of being too small.","361":"These sandals are so comfy, supportive and lots of cushion. My feet use to hurt all the time and these shoes have help with foot soreness so much. I wear them all the time. \u2764","362":"These are my favorite! Just wish the part that goes over your foot was tighter","363":"Love wearing these....so soft and comfy","364":"Tried similar ones in stores but they were plastic-y and rigid. These are so cushiony and comfy and so darned cute! The color is an earthy khaki-taupe! I usually wear a 6-6.5 US and ordered two sizes and that one that worked best was the US Women's 4-5.5 size. The larger size I ordered (6-7.5) would have also worked but they were much looser. So I would say, order down but I guess it also depends on the fit you like.","365":"I would rate this a ten if it would let me. I have plantar fasciitis and I ruptured my Achilles\u2019 tendon a few years ago. I needed something cushiony to wear around the house. These are exactly what I was looking for. I\u2019m buying another pair for outside the house. I love these!","366":"I love these! I bought a pair for my mom too. They\u2019re perfect for plantar fasciitis.","367":"The show is extremely comfortable, like walking on a cloud but with enough support. The only \u201cknock\u201d I have in this product is that it is VERY bulky; it is definitely not something I would wear as a casual shoe in public; which is kind of what I was looking for. I liken it to a Fred Flinstone shoe BUT if you are looking for an extremely comfortable shoe to wear around the house, in the yard, at the pool, this is definitely it.","368":"Love these slippers so much I ordered another pair\u2764\ufe0f","369":"Wonderful great fit.","370":"I like these!!! They are super comfortable and nice for wearing on casual days. There\u2019s also a lot of colors to choose from which is great. It runs a little big for my feet. I got the smallest size and they fit fine but they look really big on me. I would suggest sizing down.","371":"So comfortable that we bought my husband a pair. I love running errands in these shoes!","372":"I ordered one pair for myself and the fit was fine. I'm a size 6.5-7 so I ordered the woman's 6-7 in the brown\/beige. It could be a little bigger but the fit is good to wear and the color is cute. My boyfriend also wanted a pair so I ordered the Men's 10.5-11 in the blue and and the slides were a completely different color and size. It seems like it's a woman's 7.5-8.5 and it's navy blue. Nothing like the blue in the picture. 3 stars because I'm happy with mine but disappointed my boyfriend's pair is nothing what we ordered. The navy blue one is also not as soft and cushy as the beige one.","373":"These were a great value and they feel like you are walking on clouds! Most comfortable sandal I have ever wore!","374":"I can wear the clouds slides everywhere and all day. Also it did it bother my plantar fasciitis.","375":"Very comfy, but the olive green has yellow undertones and just isn\u2019t an attractive color at all","376":"They are very cute and comfy, but do not run true to size! Definitely size up.","377":"These shoes are SO comfortable! I don\u2019t like bare feet and it\u2019s too hot for slippers so I thought I\u2019d give them a try and WOW! Highly recommend. I don\u2019t wear them outside so I can\u2019t speak to durability in that regard, but as far as house shoes they are perfect","378":"I was a little reluctant to purchase these sandal, just because of how bulky them looked. Not a bulky as i thought , these are the most comfortable sandals I\u2019ve purchased.","379":"I wear a women's 8 in pretty much every shoe I own and the 7.5-8.5 was too small. Will try again with the next size up. Otherwise, no complaints.","380":"I have wide and flat feet. I need good arch support and it can be a challange. These slides are so comfortable and soft. Especially after a long day at work.","381":"Nothing","382":"These are so comfortable...I have no pressure walking at all.  They have the right name.  I love them! :-)","383":"It\u2019s kind of a little warm in the summer. But it\u2019s so comfortable and squishy I saw something similar to the shoe in Beverly Hills for $450 this beautiful comfortable shoe only cost me less than $50.  I see when the weather cools down or if it\u2019s raining this is the perfect shoe to wear","384":"Very comfortable","385":"Size down in these, I usually wear a size 9 womens and had  to order the 7.5 womens.","386":"Shoe is comfortable and lightweight","387":"it comfortable","388":"My friend has these sandals and LOVES them so I had to own a pair too! Unfortunately the size 43 was just a tad too small on my size 11 foot. My foot fit into the bed of the sandal but the footbed isn't flat, it comes up all the way around the edge so it sort of cups your foot in place.  As I walked I could feel my heel and toes touching the edge of the inside of the sandal and I didn't like how it felt.  Too bad for me! I also bought a size 45 and they fit the same way.  So I must just not like how the sandal cups my foot.  It's comfy to stand in though.  Soft but I wouldn't say supportive.  It's like a fluffy cloud for your feet.","389":"Very comfortable, show was lightweight with a cushioned bounce back sole.. I love them","390":"Okay these have to be some of the weirdest looking shoes I\u2019ve ever put on, but they were also BY FAR the most comfortable thing I\u2019ve put on my feet. It legit felt like walking on a cloud. I ordered my normal size and they fit great!","391":"Very comfortable shoes","392":"I am obsessed with these. They are so comfortable and look cute with so many things! I want them in every color!","393":"So comfy!!! You won\u2019t regret buying these!!","394":"Super","395":"Gteast buy","396":"Literally feels like you\u2019re walking with pillows\/clouds on your feet. I love them!!","397":"These are worth the hype! This brand! Do not be distracted by knock offs! Order 1\/2 size up. I range between a 7 and 8 depending on brand. I got the 8 and they are perfect! So comfortable, soft and supportive","398":"I love these for walking around our building!!","399":"Amazing price point for an incredible degree of comfort","400":"I found this sandals very comfortable to wear at home. They\u2019re super soft, I like the color but I wouldn\u2019t wear them outside the house though.","401":"Amazing and soooo comfy. Little big but that isn\u2019t so bad. Maybe size down","402":"I work at a dog grooming salon and these shoes are perfect for after work","403":"My son is very very very happy the very just so I can post this review:)","404":"Nice and comfortable","405":"I had injured my foot and couldn't walk. The ground and even the rugs in my house felt so hard and made the pain so much worse. My daughter ordered these and they helped dramatically. Feels like I'm walking on clouds.","406":"Very nice for a pair of inexpensive slippers, suitable to wear outside also.","407":"I told myself I\u2019d never get these slides because they weren\u2019t cute..but I needed a house shoe to wear because it\u2019s too hot for slippers. When I tell you these are the most comfy shoes ever, I mean it. The only down side is I ordered the yellow pair & they ran a little bit, then I ordered the leopard pair in the same size and they ran a little small; they both will work but they are definitely size different.","408":"i like it , wery wery comfortable \ud83d\ude4f thank you and so important !! early coming thank you \ud83d\ude4f","409":"I love these shoes! They are perfect for wearing around the house or taking on vacation. Super super comfortable, I have recommended them to so many people!","410":"I love these shoes! They are just as soft as they look!","411":"They aren't the softest i've ever felt but they are super comfy. I use them as indoor slippers only.","412":"I\u2019ve bought so many different kinds of these from expensive (TOMs) to Walmart, Amazon and Shein- none of them even compare to these. Literally like walking on a memory foam mattress. I might buy them in all colors \ud83d\ude2c","413":"Love how comfortable they are.","414":"I have so many pairs and I'm obsessed. They are so comfortable and feels like you're walking on air!","415":"Comfy footwear for home and running errands.","416":"Love them","417":"Wish they would make shoes with the comfortable soles.","418":"I\u2019m on my feet constantly and my feet hurt especially after playing tennis.  These feel great wearing them and my feet feel much better..  I wear socks with them sometimes.","419":"me gusta","420":"The best house shoes! Very comfy especially when on your feet a lot.","421":"Bought for my daughter m, she lives them and lives in them. Like walking in clouds- so incredibly soft and dreamy - very trendy shoe, lots of compliments.","422":"This is the most comfortable shoe it molds to the foot bed and adds bounce.","423":"WOWWW... so soft!!","424":"I absolutely love these slides they are so amazing and comfortable. I was blown away by how soft they were I wear them everywhere. The only thing is that they do shrink if you leave them out in the sun for too long.","425":"I \u2764\ufe0f them","426":"I bought these for my husband to have an easy pair of slip on shoes for around the house. They have a cushioned sole and are very comfortable according to him.","427":"I love to wear these after six hours straight of being on my feet. I would recommend that they only be worn in the house.","428":"Most comfortable shoe for my joint pain!!","429":"Love the color and the fit. Just a little big. But if you leave them in the sun they shrink!","430":"So comfortable, worth every penny.","431":"The slipper is a bit too large\/wide  for my 5-1\/2 shoe fit.  Although a little loose, it is very padded and comfortable to step.  Our floors are tiled and the slipper has a good grip and standing in the kitchen, I am taller!","432":"these are so cute, im wearing them as inside shoes but can be worn outside.","433":"love the price and comfort . They stretch out a littleso I gave it  4 out of 5 on support .","434":"These are super comfortable for wearing around the house.  They fit fine and are very cushioning if you have tile floors.","435":"My feet feel so good as if walking on a cloud","436":"Love these shoes. Feels so good on my feet. They feel super durable but are also light weight. 10\/10","437":"Comfy to slip on in warm weather!","438":"These are such ugly\/cute shoes! Lol very comfortable and glad I purchased them.","439":"My feet are happy!  Very cushiony like walking on a cloud but has support as well.","440":"Color is spot on,  size is just right,  and comfy!","441":"So comfortable!!","442":"I love these slippers as indoor slippers! They are so comfy and keep any little bits on the floor from sticking to my feet so I always feel really clean :) I\u2019m a size 6-7 normally and the size 6-7 womens ones I got fit perfectly.","443":"The shoe is suuupppeerr comfortable. It\u2019s just a tad short. I bought a size 9-10. I should have gone a size up. My foot reaches the edge in the back and if I scoot my foot up my toes will go over just ever so slightly. Still comfy though.","444":"These shoes feel like I'm walking on air. They fit as expected. Super comfortable and sturdy. I definitely recommend","445":"Momma got some feet that are expandinggg and these fit her great.  Provided a ton of comfort for her as she dealt with her mid summer pregnancy.  She uses them every day and loves the comfort they provide as she asks me for more popsicles and to turn the AC down.  She highly recommends these for cute little fat pregnant feetsies.","446":"These are very comfortable","447":"Nice slippers","448":"Great feel, too short for sz ordered","449":"This shoe is fabulous! Very soft with support . I am a flight attendant and these make great shower shoes, walking around the hotel, pool side, and just lounging around. Very light, easy to pack.","450":"The comfort of these is out of this world! Would recommend it to anyone.","451":"I have hardwood floors and walk around barefoot during the warmer months, so my feet were starting to hurt. These slippers looked like a good option to cushion my feet while still keeping them cool. Well, they\u2019re great! Super cushy, fit perfectly, and did the trick for my aching feet. Highly recommend!","452":"I don't usually write reviews unless the item is GREAT. These sandals are so comfy and I've had so many compliments. A TON of ppl thought these were Yeezy slides. But aside from all that I have a bad back and these are a dream to walk in. And don't leave my back hurting at night. The only thing I would say about them is if you have a skinny foot, you may have to wear thicker socks, because there is some gapping from the top of my foot to the sandal itself. Oh also size up. I usually wear an 8. I got the 9\/10 and they fit perfect.","453":"I really wish these had fit me. They are super comfortable and feel like you are walking on a cloud. They remind me of crocs but open toed. I do wish they were cuter. I did not keep them as they are way too wide and I have average width feet with narrow heels. I could not keep them on","454":"The wider your foot the higher up your size. Anything over a WW, should probably go up 2 sizes.","455":"These slippers are very comfortable. They can be worn anywhere anytime with different outfits. I was pleasantly surprised because I have flat feet and always have a problem finding the right fit.","456":"Suffer from foot challenges; now I am a happy woman.  These cloud slides make a real difference in my happiness.  Thank you very very much.PS Purchased a different slide that was not the same quality\u2026buyer beware.  Look for \u201ccloud\u201d softness if that is indeed what you seek.","457":"Super comfortable, I love them. The only thing is they aren\u2019t for long distance walking.","458":"Got these to wear for the summer while my toes heal. I only wear these with socks, (which is a look I absolutely hate, btw) and so far they are comfy. They don't slip off when I walk, they are cushy, and the material (feels kinda like rubber) doesn't bother my feet.I will check in again after wearing them for a few months","459":"It\u2019s super comfortable and feels so soft. I love wearing it around my home! I wouldn\u2019t wear publicly bc it\u2019s a little bulky for outdoor use, but perfect in my home where fashion doesn\u2019t matter","460":"Very comfortable","461":"Me encanta","462":"Love these shoes I wear them all the time. I\u2019m extremely active and they\u2019re great recovery shoes. Only issue is they\u2019re too small. It\u2019s not super noticeable but once in a while my toe hangs off. If you\u2019re a half size you might want to size up.","463":"Son muy c\u00f3modas las recomiendo son incre\u00edbles de verdad","464":"The shoes are perfect and very comfortable for around the house. The material is really good.","465":"These are so soft and comfy that I want to order them in every color.  They are perfect after a long day at work, or on a run to the store or a trip to the pool, or just to wear all day.","466":"My feet have been bothering me since working from home and always barefoot. These are perfect for around the house to save my feet from the hard floors.","467":"Great comfort at a reasonable price, truly - cloud like.  Enjoyed them so much I purchased another paid to wear as house slippers. Thanks for a good product! Bronax.","468":"I don\u2019t understand the sizing. I ordered 3 pairs at the same time, same size, 2 different styles though. Two of the same style did not fit. I returned them. They\u2019re either too large or too small. Oh well! But they are super comfortable!","469":"I was hesitant to get these because I've tried a lot of \"cushy\" type shoes\/sandals that just fall flat after wearing them.  These are great as house shoes or watering the yard at the end of the day.  They are very roomy and lots of support.","470":"","471":"I have had several types of these shoes, and these have been the softest","472":"I loved the pain relief these gave me\ud83e\udd70","473":"super comfortable","474":"They are very comfortable and lightweight..","475":"I\u2019ve been looking for a comfortable slip on shoe that would help keep my feet happy. These shoes are just that! It is truly like walking on clouds! The arch support is great and my feet don\u2019t hurt at all after wearing them all day. I honestly feel the shoes have helped with my lower back pain as well. I believe they absorb the shock when walking on hard surfaces. I was concerned that I might have a problem driving in them but that is not the case.I just ordered a second pair. That should tell anyone thinking about buying them that I think they and their feet will be happy too!","476":"I wear a 9.5 in womens shoes. I ordered the 9-10 women's size. It's pretty small to the point to where I'm not going to wear them. The back has a lip which my feet go over and it's noticeable to where I can feel it. Returning these and ordering the 10.5-11.5 women's size which I've never worn anything above a 10 in my life. They are incredibly comfortable though despite being too small which is the only reason why I am ordering the correct size. Usually I just return and never order again.","477":"Great for working from home. So comfy and supportive and they fit perfectly!","478":"Im so happy with these sandals, but don\u2019t go with the shoe size because you will be off by at least 2 sizes too large, it happened  to me.You have to measure your foot then go to their size chart and find your size for this sandal, that\u2019s the way to do it. I\u2019m a regular 8.5 size and in this sandals I\u2019m a 5.5 size and they fit perfectly.","479":"I ended up giving these to my mom because they were WAY too small for me! I\u2019m not sure if my feet grew overnight, but I\u2019ve always been a 10.5, so figured I\u2019d be safe with the size I ordered. They\u2019re super comfy and look awesome, so it\u2019s a good thing my mama\u2019s feet are smaller\/able to fit. Bummed they don\u2019t come in bigger sizes.","480":"Super comfy, recommend \ud83d\udc4c","481":"Muy grande para el tama\u00f1o","482":"Love these","483":"Liked","484":"Great support and all around super comfy!","485":"Shrink!!!Omg I left these in the hot car for 3hours and they totally shrank by 3 sizes I can't get my foot into them now. I still loved them and want more, just NEVER leave them in your car!!!","486":"These were a gift for my mom and she loves them! She said that they are so comfortable and they make her tired feet feel good!","487":"These are very squishy and comfortable, like walking on pillows.  However, if you are looking for arch support they don't have arch support.  Still a great buy.","488":"These fit as expected, true to size. They are definitely soft and comfortable. I have problem feet so I feel like they do not give my feet much support at all, but I love slipping them on as a slipper until I change to regular shoes.","489":"Best slides ever they are so soft & the support is great! I need all colors","490":"Reasonably priced and use it inside my house but also have been known to wear them out.","491":"Arrived in great shape and right size (length), however they should be sized for weight as well apparently. I can't keep my feet from sliding around in them unless I wear super thick socks (not a look I want to be caught outside my house with). Its a fight to stay balanced for me because they aren't secure to my feet. A little afraid of falling or turning an ankle. Not having \"chunky\" feet for first time is a drawback.Having said that, when I do have two pairs of socks on and they aren't slipping off or sideways, they are wonderful. So nice to slip into them after I'm through working. Very, very good at shock absorbing.Sum up:Positive: Glad I bought them at least for inside use, easy to clean, they really absorb shock well so,  when not falling off, they're comfortable as he--.Not so positive: lack of stability and size adjustability for height of a human, female foot (if you're a Sasquatch you're good). I had a friend with a thicker foot than mine try them and she had trouble keeping them on as well. I won't wear them outside (see above for double sock comment), cool footwear for hot temps negated for me by need to wear sock with them.Am I glad I bought Them Would? EhWould I buy them again? Probably notWould I recommend them to a friend? No.Am I so disappointed I would return them? NoPrice for usability? Out of 10, I give them a 4 only because of the size\/stability issue for me.","492":"These came as kids shoesizes but advertised as women size!!!!","493":"I run to the comfort of these shoes and wear them everyday when I take off my work shoes.  To me it feels like walking on a pillow a firm pillow a supportive pillow a soothing pillow. I actually want this these shoes in multiple colors. I wear when I get pedicures I wear when my feet are sore and I'm going grocery shopping.","494":"My daughter bought these and she seems to love them. I have not tried them on but if she likes them they are probably a five","495":"I like that it's extremely comfortable, it offers a lot of support great for taking a walk.","496":"These slippers have been awesome (especially living somewhere really warm in the summer). They keep my feet cool but also provide support. I\u2019m really happy with my purchase and would highly recommend them.","497":"These are cheap and comfy just as I had hoped. They fit true to size, I am normally 7.5 and on the wide side so sometimes have to size up. Went with the 39-40 and they fit perfect.My issue is the color, I went with the pretty olive green, but received pea soup green. I wish I got the pink ones. I didn\u2019t want to deal with returns so I just kept these ugly colored ones.","498":"When my daughter bought her pair, she insisted that I try it, as she found it so comfortable. That trial led to me buying myself & husband a pair each.As we age, having comfortable footwear is very important and this product did not disappoint.You will not regret this purchase.","499":"So squishy and comfortable !!!","500":"I don\u2019t like to use my shoes inside my house, this are great!","501":"I tried a different brand, same color and size and they werr huge!! Gave this brand s try (Normally wear 8\/8.5) and they were perfect! They are softer & more cushion than the first pair. I see some colors\/sizes range so I'll have to be careful with my next pair. Highly recommend!","502":"Love the way the feel on my feet had to purchase a second pair love love like walking on a cloud.","503":"Ver comfortable.  I like it","504":"They are so soft and my feet loves them","505":"Fell in love with these as soon as I put them on. Got them for my oldest daughter for her birthday. Now everyone in the family wants a pair. So comfortable. Highly recommend.","506":"These are amazingly comfortable and really love them, super buy!!","507":"I've been dealing with plantar fasciitis and the squishy comfortable support of these slides has been really helpful for wearing around the house. But they're kinda ugly","508":"I probably will never wear them outside the house but they are super comfortable!","509":"These are so soft and squishy - perfect for around the house. Problem is the toe strap that goes across the top is very large. I have very wide feet and this strap is still too big so my shoes flop around when I walk. Other than that they are pretty comfy.","510":"Such amazing quality. Love the nude color.","511":"They are huge! My foot is swimming in these, too long and too wide! Disappointed because they feel like they are nice to walk in, BUT no way is this the right size!","512":"bought these originally for one of my friends birthday i tried them on and had to get them for myself. they are actually the comfiest most supportive slide. 20\/10","513":"Fit perfectly. Love the colour. Very comfortable!","514":"These things are the best thing I've had onmy feet ever,,love them,cushion level is perfect,my feet won't hurt all the time now :)","515":"Highly cushioned.  Super nice","516":"La comodidad","517":"Really comfy and cute. I wear them all the time.","518":"Helps keep hard surfaces low impact. Shock absorbing.","519":"Love the. Color.Love how squishy they feel.I have skinny feet.I wish the top part was tighter.","520":"So comfortable! I\u2019m normally a 8.5\/9 in most shoes and I ordered the 7.5-8.5 in woman\u2019s. Wish there was a 9-9.5 size, but these will work. This is the tan color!","521":"Second pair I purchased, first pair was animal print, perfect in every way, this pair is same size but is too big, runs half size bigger than first pair!","522":"I purchased the grey and have worn everyday around the house and at the pool since they arrived. They are more comfortable than my crocs. They are slightly larger than I expected but for around the house I don\u2019t not care.","523":"Highly recommended","524":"Lovely pair of sandals, and great for comfort! The only issue I have with them are the ridges and imperfections that they have, would be great to scan them well before sending them off. Thank you.","525":"I have rheumatoid arthritis in my feet. These shoes provide much needed comfort. I just ordered 2 additional pairs.","526":"Amazing and super soft and comfortable!! 10\/10","527":"I want these super soft foam slippers in every color!  There fantastic and great! I wear them around the house, to the store and want them in every color!They run alittle big than usual but it\u2019s okay I have plenty of space either way!Softest slip I\u2019ve ever owned!","528":"the most comfiest slides ever, they genuinely feel like you\u2019re walking on clouds. true to size.","529":"Perfect slides for wearing around the house. Im a stay at home mom and always on my feet so I needed something for foot support and my bad back. These help with that so much!!","530":"I highly recommend these slides. I have had feet\/heel problems the last year and cannot find a comfortable pair of house shoes. I give theses slides 5 stars \u2b50\ufe0f  Super soft and spongy with ever step my feet feel great. I\u2019m super happy about my purchase. I\u2019m ordering another pair to have as outside shoes.","531":"It\u2019s a gift for my dad. Very comfortable and light  In good quality and the size is correct","532":"The info for these said to order up. I usually wear 8 1\/2 or 9\u2019s. I ordered 9\u2019s.  They are too big for me.  They are somewhat comfortable but just not quite right.  I would not order another pair. So disappointed.","533":"Very comfortable slide. Exactly as pictured.","534":"I am pregnant and my feet have always been wide, but they have recently swollen dramatically. I was very nervous these slides wouldn\u2019t fit but they slipped right on. They are so comfortable I compare them to walking on a cloud. I highly recommend them and will definitely purchase more!","535":"These are definitely the best brand of this style of shoe. I bought a pair from a big name store and these are much more comfortable.","536":"They are as expected (super cushioning, super comfortable). The sizing seems perfect (I chose a 6) however, these are a very wide fit. I\u2019ll only be able to use them as warm weather type house slippers. Though I\u2019ll need to be careful not to have them fall off, they\u2019re ideal for swapping out of my usual house slippers when stepping out into my yard for a moment (like to bring trash to the outside bins) when the ground is wet","537":"Great Product Speedy Delivery","538":"I really like how soft and cushy these shoes are. They are great for around the house.","539":"Comfort","540":"It\u2019s like walking on clouds. Super squishy. It\u2019s also easy to walk on the beach\/sand with them. I used them as house shoes too. I\u2019m going to order more colors. I have a natural size 7.5 and went with the size it automatically gave me but they\u2019re pretty big so I might try a size down. Love these a lot.","541":"Excellent product","542":"Comfiest slides I own! Do run a little small but the fit perfectly. If you want them a little bigger I would recommend sizing up one","543":"Purchased these and also purchased the oofos (almost triple the price)....IMHO this is a much better value than the oofos! Returned the oofos.","544":"These are so comfy and I am only wearing them in the house now, so they are lovely! I would buy again!","545":"Wear everyday and just ordered another pair!!!","546":"These are very affordable and super comfy!","547":"I had been looking at this style of shoe for awhile. This is how I shop - I like to mull things over. I wish now I hadn't wasted so much time thinking about it. All that time I could've been wearing & enjoying these heavenly slides. They are so comfy & not at all flimsy or floppy. The softness & support you feel under your whole foot feels so good it's hard to describe. All I can say is BUY THEM - NOW! I wear a size 10 in a shoe. I bought the size suggested for a size 10. As you can see, my foot sits down into the slide perfectly - with no overhang.","548":"Shoes are very wide and bulky in comparison to the ones I had previously purchased at another retailer. I tried to match using pics of these shoes and reading reviews. Unfortunately, they did not come close to having the same manufacturing standards and I can not wear them outside as they look way to big (width).  They are cushy and feel pretty good just not what I wanted.","549":"I wear these shoes everyday! They are so comfy and good to just throw on and run errands in. Highly recommend","550":"They are comfy but I wouldn\u2019t say they feel like you\u2019re walking on clouds.  They do wear good and I have worn them to the store but I mainly wear them as slippers.","551":"Not really a sandal to wear out and about, but good for a house slipper. So soft and comfortable. Also cute color, I got blush. A little tight if you have wide feet but works ok.","552":"Love these. They are so soft and have lasted well with constant use for the past few weeks.","553":"Comfy with socks","554":"These are really comfortable slippers. I never wear slippers but these are just so easy to slip on and off and so light on my feet.  Wore them out to the store on multiple occasions already and the perfect work from home slippers and my dog has not chewed on them yet which is a bonus.","555":"You will not be disappointed. Literally the most comfy slides I own!","556":"We have hardwood floors in our new home and it was killing my knees and back, so I bought these as house shoes and wow! I was so surprised at how comfortable these were. They\u2019re so ugly and albeit I feel like SpongeBob wearing them but I haven\u2019t had a single ounce of pain since I bought these. My husband was even making fun of them but when I made him try them on, he was begging for a pair, lol","557":"Great summer home slippers","558":"This is my second pair. I LOVE THEM. and I gift them to people I love because they are so comfortable. They've also made a huge difference on my wife's foot pain. They are like walking in clouds. I'll forever order these.","559":"I was looking for a shoe that was lightweight and could get wet.  I bought them in navy blue and blush.  They\u2019re great for around the house or wear outside to get mail etc","560":"Very comfortable","561":"These slippers are great. They make you feel like you are walking on marshmallows. They give my feet support and they are comfortable.","562":"I wanted so badly to hate these because honestly they are super ugly in my opinion but they are like walking on a cloud. Your feet will be so happy. Just don't look down and your all good.","563":"Bought them for my spoiled teen with flat feet. She never wore them.. I tried them...(In a Freddy Krouger's Voice) AND NOW THEY ARE MINE!!!!l lol","564":"Have tried other brands on here but struggled finding mens size in other brands, these were one of the few that have larger size so went with these but definitely not as plush as other ones I have tried. Still pretty comfortable though","565":"I live in Puma brand slides at home because I'm lazy.....I wanted an upgraded flip flop for light errands and house work. I have been wearing these everyday for 3 months and I love them.  Size 10 in woman's shoes, I have narrow feet. A little gapping around the foot and saddle piece but I haven't slipped out of them yet. They have such a thick sole it's keeps dust and dirt away from my exposed skin.  I get regular pedicures and I pretend these are more expensive leisure wear than what they are. I'll get dressed up casually cute and rock these.  My full time job requires I wear big heavy protective footwear so these sandals are perfect to switch into after work. Decidedly a top contender for future gift giving on holidays.","566":"Super comfy and fits just right. I would recommend a friend or family to purchase.","567":"At first I thought they were too big for me but I started wearing them and now I looove them. I ordered another pair from another company and they did not compare to these in the comfort arena!","568":"180, 5,4, med width foot, wear a 9 in nike, 10 in loboutin, 8.5 in sam edelman. Bought a 9-10 too big to wear out not secure at all.","569":"I use this slippers for every thing! Outside to water the flowers\u2026to the store\u2026.in the morning getting ready\u2026very convenient","570":"Super comfy! And they got to me a day earlier than promised.","571":"I'd give them a '5' star rating, except for the fact that they are made for a wide woman's foot. Why can't a true medium width for women's feet be made? Even wide, they are very comfortable but tend to slide off my feet. I wear them in the house only. My husband wants them, and I will probably let him have them.","572":"Very comfortable, I have foot problems and these are great for neighborhood walks with my dog or running errands.","573":"Very comfortable!","574":"I bought these to wear around the house instead of my flat no support flip flops. They\u2019re super soft and comfortable. My husband got jealous, I had to order him a pair \ud83d\ude01 I normally wear an 8 1\/2, they are true to size. The strap is a little loose but not a big deal.","575":"Cuando las vi me parecieron muy grandes, pero al probarlas resultaron  muy c\u00f3modas y acolchonadas. Le regal\u00e9 un par a una amiga y dijo lo mismo. No son las mismas de otras tiendas, esas son de pl\u00e1stico duro y estas son como de silicona.","576":"Love these!  So comfy! Received them yesterday and have hardly taken them off!  True to size and no need to stretch with socks, as I\u2019ve read in other reviews. Want in every color and a great price!, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! Get them now, you won\u2019t be disappointed!","577":"Purchased for my wife, she loves them!","578":"I needed shower shoes for college and these came up first so I bought them. They are good but I just wish I chose shows that were flatter and wouldn't really hold the water. Overall though they aren't bad.","579":"I bought these in white.. I love everything about them. The comfort is unbelievable. I can't stop wearing!! I ordered 3 other kinds from other stores on AMAZON. BIG MISTAKE on my part! THESE ARE BY FAR THE MOST COMFORTABLE and CUSHIONED... and sizing is accurate! I'll be ordering more. $Buy Buy Buy$","580":"Absolutely love these shoes! Needed something for everyday wear around the house. These are perfect. They are comfy and provide great support throughout the day. My feet no longer hurt at the end of the day.","581":"I recommend putting them in the dryer on High for a few minutes to soften them up then put them on immediately\/ do not allow to cool first\u2026.and they will mold to a perfect fit for you!!I Intended to wear in the house Only but they are SoComfyCozy that I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of putting shoes on  So I ended up wearing them to go out . I am ordering another pair today.The Only thing I would change is I would like cut outs on each side especially for summer and because the band is quite wide\u2026 my feet need air! But otherwise they\u2019re Great!","582":"I suffer from foot neuropathy. Have a hard time finding comfortable shoes. These are like walking on a cloud. Would recommend, and I will be ordering more. Plenty of colors to choose from.","583":"So these shoes are super comfy and I love them. Downside is, even after sizing up knowing they shrink in the heat, they just continue to shrink! I use these for going to and from the pool\/outside chores. Well I live we\u2019re it\u2019s usually 100+ degrees outside so even if they sit out for 20mins outside with me, they shrink. I exchanged my first pair for the next size up when I found out about the shrinkage. However I thought they\u2019d only shrink to a certain point. That\u2019s not the case. They keep shrinking on me and now my toes and heels curl over the edges and I\u2019d need a new pair entirely. Bummed because they really are awesome and cozy, until they keep shrinking to the point of becoming doll shoes.","584":"Comfortable durable appropriate fit collar appropriate no problems nice indoor outdoor shoe","585":"So, I gave in and got the ugly yet simple slides. I had been looking for an alternative to the oofos flip flops that are super cushioned and give support for simple daily activities and found these. Are they some what ugly? Yes. Do they match everything and give good support? Absolutely. I highly recommend this cheaper alternative to wearing oofos. They are nice to wear around the house to vent my feet instead of hot slippers in the summer. These do run a little bit big as I am normally a 6-7 and they fit like a 7-8. Highly recommended!","586":"Very comfy and supportive! I am no longer able toWear cute flat sandals or flip flops. I pay for it dearly if I do. I will say these are not the cutest but my feet, especially my heels, are not hurting after wearing them for hours. Definitely recommend!!","587":"Comfortable Shoes","588":"The shoes would be comfortable, but they run big.","589":"I bought another pair","590":"I like the shoe but it does run bigger than the size I requested. Started causing nerve pain in my toes.","591":"Very deep comfy padding . No foot\/heal pain when wearing this . Sizes run way large . Too large to safely wear outside . Should have returned , but will keep just to wear inside . Think if size fit properly could wear everywhere .","592":"I had no idea how much I would love wearing these sandals.  They are so soft and have so much cushion. You should not pass the chance to purchase these sandals.  I have a very high arch and they have support all around.  Run do not walk to get these!!!","593":"Very cushy, good for plantar fasciitis relief. Like Crocs they\u2019re quite ugly, so wouldn\u2019t wear them out & about but they\u2019re fine for around the house. Size is oddly large. I wear a 6.5\/7 shoe so ordered the 6\/7. You can see in the picture the shoe is a good inch longer than my foot.","594":"I JUST received these. They\u2019re comfy and have a good grip on tiled flooring.I wear a size 10, ordered Womens 9-10.Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m pregnant but I\u2019d order a size up but these will do since i just need them for around the house. If I fit my heels into the curve of the shoe, my toes slightly sit on the toe curve of the shoe.I\u2019d recommend them still.","595":"These are very comfortable slippers. I have wide feet (D) and these have more than enough room. Didn't need to use a hairdryer to widen or soften them. Highly recommend.","596":"A little bigger than expected, but very soft and comfortable.","597":"I\u2019m a sucker for social media advertising. These are a knockoff but totally fit my needs as I was just looking for something to wear around the house and these got great reviews. I only wore them a handful of times. The strap that goes across your foot cracked \/ split. Sending them back.","598":"This is the most comfortable slipper ever!!","599":"They are super comfortable very supportive and very soft. I love this brand and  I will buy it again.","600":"Ordered  correct size first time-way too big.  Reordered size down.  Ridiculously ugly but ridiculously most wonderful fit.  Don\u2019t understand sizing","601":"Took about 2 1\/2 weeks til your foot molds and to get used to the floating on air feeling but so worth it.  Very, very comfy!","602":"Great for poolside or using keep feet germ free at YMCA poolside and showers.","603":"I wear these everywhere!","604":"Shoes are very hard to balance on due to too much rubber on soles. Feels like you're going to tip forward or\/and backwards. Not recommended for folks who have trouble with mobility.","605":"Easy fit and very comfortable for wearing around the house","606":"I love my slides!!! So comfy and soft. I can stand for long periods with them on.","607":"I\u2019ve had these for over a month now and wouldn\u2019t buy them again. While it initially fit ok (size 11), the support isn\u2019t where I thought it would be and they feel slightly awkward when wearing. The cushion impact level is pretty good and the over-sized bottom, which protects your toes, is fine, but they just aren\u2019t quite right. Some reviewer wrote that they shrink, which I thought that was crazy when I read it, but now the left shoe  doesn\u2019t fit anymore and is very tight to where I can barely cramp my foot in. Go figure! I\u2019ll pass on these.","608":"Quality for the price.","609":"So when I ordered these slippers for myself I was looking more into like a casual outside shoes, but once I got them I realized these were really like house slippers\u2026 well i first slipped them in after working (where I stand for most of the day) and It felt like a was standing On a cloud\u2026 I felt weightless and like if they were moon shoes and till this day I can\u2019t stop raving about them\u2026 I have bought them for my boyfriend for our anniversary and for my mom for Mother\u2019s Day and they both love how comfy they are especially after their feet are in pain from working and standing all day\u2026 10\/10","610":"They feel dreamy! The only drawback is they are so cushy that it is hard to walk in at times. I would not recommend for older, unstable adults.","611":"Comfort is key! And Value! Easy to slip on and off.","612":"All I can say feels like I\u2019m walking on a marshmallow cloud.","613":"I bought this product to switch out of my slippers when going outside. They feel great for walking on concrete.","614":"The blue color is beautiful. They are so what comfortable if you are not obese. I weight 300 pounds and the back part basically collapses so you end up having your feet at an angle. If you have a high arch they\u2019ll seem a little tight, not too bad. If your feet are swollen maybe go up a size, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019ll help. I have them to my husband who weighs 165 and he loves them. Do not get them wet or you\u2019ll be sliding off of them. Trip hazard, my husband d was carrying a bag of rocks and almost twisted his ankle. Also, the area where the band is on top of your foot is going. To sweat (even inside the house). But that was my experience.","615":"They are ugly but they are sooo comfortable. I sized up but could have gotten my regular size. But they are just for my house. I have plantar fasciitis and on my feet for hours all day. Was painful to walk around when I got home with normal slippers. I was desperate. These did the trick. So comfortable and no more pain walking around. Wish they were cuter to wear outside. But I would say if you have issues with feet, get them now","616":"My daughter bought these out of state and love them so I got three pairs for me and my other daughters, all of them more uncomfortable & rubbed on the top of your feet\u2026 They made the worst squeaking or farting sound every time you took a step. I sent them right back it\u2019s such a shame because I was so looking forward to them","617":"Si esposa se siente c\u00f3moda con las pantuflas","618":"So comfortable!! Does make a flip flop noice be warned. Overall, love and would recommend!!","619":"I like that my foot does not slip forward. Very comfortable.","620":"These slides would be great if I didn't have a bunion on my (R) foot. Not the slides fault tho. Too bad they don't have a fip flop version...that would be perfect! Otherwise they really have good support.","621":"soft and comfy like a pillow. Runs a tad large but great for house shoes","622":"Bought these in pink and black.  Pink ones definitely more soft and comfy!  Love them!  Bought gray for hubby and yellow for daughter.  Everyone loves them!","623":"Very very comfortable shoe and made durable","624":"Super comfortable and Foot pain is gone. Will recommend to anyone","625":"Wonderful support and comfort.","626":"These fit my foot horizontally but not vertically.  Kept flying off my feet they were so loose.  Gave them to a friend.  Yeah, they were soft.  But the strap across the foot was too high.","627":"Very soft and light","628":"These are really comfortable but run large, like what all the other reviews have said. I wear a size 6 and bought the size 5. Great to wear around the house!","629":"These are very comfy and soft, but they run a bit large. The instructions recommended using a hair dryer to shrink the tops to fit, but ten minutes of hot air did nothing for mine. Can\u2019t speak to durability since I\u2019ve only had them four days, but they already have an imprint of my foot shape on the bottom already so I\u2019m slightly concerned that they may not hold up long term.","630":"I love these! They are so comfortable! It\u2019s like walking on a cloud!","631":"great if you have wide feet.","632":"Love this slide!  It\u2019s not the most attractive but it\u2019s a shower shoe\/house slipper.  It looks like a Big Foot casting..lol!  No pain anymore from my plantar fasciitis and heel spurs!  If you\u2019re suffering from foot pain or swelling, get this slide!  True to size with room to wear socks.","633":"Don\u2019t get me wrong, I absolutely love these shoes. It\u2019s like walking on a pillow or a cloud. They do run wide, probably because they are unisex sizing. I can still walk fine in them. I wear them everywhere. I couldn\u2019t believe how much cushion they have. They run true to size, the strap was just a little big.","634":"Love how soft and cushiony these are, only wish they weren\u2019t so wide (but I have a narrow foot)","635":"Un 10 en comodidad y un 10 en suavidad","636":"Comfortable, durable (my puppy hasn\u2019t destroyed them). I wear them everyday!","637":"Bello se lo recomiendo","638":"I work from home and have hard floors so these cushion slides were worth a shot. I should have ordered these eons ago. I went with this brand because others had issues with the bands being too tight or awkward and I didn\u2019t see that with the BRONAX reviews. I have normal feet, not wide or narrow. I ordered the beige slides first and they fit exactly as any other slides do that range between 2 sizes (I am always a 9 unless shoes run small I size up to 9.5). I ordered the 9\/10 and I feel they fit perfect. I was cautious ordering black because some reviews mentioned the sizing was off. I have photo comparison and this is not the case at all. I will say my beige ones are softer because the black seem a bit more stiff in the sole (they fit the same though), but not sure if I have just broken them in in the last couple weeks. I literally go everywhere in these bad boys. They go great with my sweats and crop tops. Their sole is made to withstand gentle outdoor use so I wear them on errands too.","639":"Great fit and super comfy to wear\u2026 I don\u2019t take them off unless I really need too. They also dry very quickly and doesn\u2019t absorb any water.I\u2019m thinking about getting more colors.","640":"I am 5', 100lb. and shoe size is 5. The slippers are for women in shoe sizes 4-5.5 but they are too long for my feet.","641":"These just arrived and I immediately put them on... WOW! I love them! I just ordered a second pair, ha! I don't know the longevity yet, since I literally have only worn them for not even a full day, but these are just so comfortable... like walking on puffy clouds, which it says in the description! I wear an 8.5 in women's shoes and I ordered the 7.5-8.5 and they're perfect! I prefer being barefoot, but my feet can't handle hard floors anymore and I really need something with cushion, so I read the reviews and took a chance... so glad I did. Shipping was quick, too! Even though we're living overseas at the moment, they got here in a decent time. Quite pleased with the whole experience!","642":"I've tried 3 brands of \"pillow\" slippers, and this is by far the squishiest and most comfortable. I wear a women's size 6.5 shoe (or size 37 in European sizes), so I got the size 6-7. They fit with room to spare for socks, which means I will be wearing these in winter as well. lol","643":"So comfortable and cute!","644":"Comfortable","645":"I was so happy when I got these slides! The left foot slid right in and I would have given it 5 stars for comfort, but when I went to try on the right foot, it didn\u2019t fit at all. Then I compared them side by side and realized I received 2 different shoes, 2 different sizes!! Perhaps a shipping error. Returning these and maybe ordering again?? If it happens again, I\u2019ll know the shoe gods don\u2019t want me to have these.","646":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0These are super comfortable! Just be careful never to leave them in a hot car or outside. They will shrink.","647":"The slide is too large ONLY bc I overestimated the size of my own feet - I fall between a 10-10.5 womens. Pretty much live in them anyway and will be buying correct size.These feel like fluffy clouds. My feet have been in chronic pain after decades of bartending and these slides give them the relief they\u2019ve been screaming for. They\u2019ve helped my feet become more tolerant of regular shoes or heels, and give instant comfort and relief when I switch out of regular shoes. Highly recommend for anyone suffering from plantar fasciitis, turf toe, high\/low arches, basically any foot issue.","648":"These are the best support house sandles ever! They are true to size. My feet feel supported all day, I wear them at home since I have hardwood floors. Ordered another pair one for indoor and one for outdoor comfort.","649":"I read many other reviews and wasn't sure what to make of them all. Good\/bad.....like a cloud\/hard as a brick.......broken foot???? I have several foot issues, myself, and was frankly desperate to find something that would relieve my pain. When the slippers arrived the 1st thing I noticed was that the green pairs I ordered looked a bit more khaki colored. But, no problem.....they're ok. Once I put them on, YES, they felt wonderfully comfortable on the soles my feet. HOWEVER, they are mighty darn big! I ordered my usual size but my husband started to laugh and said they looked like clodhoppers! Not exactly a fashion statement. I do need to slightly grip my toes to avoid flinging them ahead of me and can understand how one woman twisted her ankle and end up with a broken foot bone. Despite the drawbacks, the relief I've gotten from these slippers has warranted the quirks. I don't know how long the sponginess will last, but I will purchase another pair......just a size smaller.","650":"A gigt","651":"Love these shoes","652":"Very comfortable and it does fit nicely and has good support","653":"They are very comfy but when your feet sweat on hot days they rub.","654":"These feel like walking on a rand are super comfortable and supportive lovveee","655":"Not cute but comfy","656":"I was really disappointed. I need a 41. My husband ordered a 41. They're about \u215b\u201c too small. They're a 40-41. Either my heel is hanging off the back or my toes are rubbing the front of the shoe. I really want to like them so we got the next size up and I looked like I had clown shoes on. They were way to big and very wide 42-43. Beware","657":"I personally am wearing them","658":"Love these!!! So comfortable!!","659":"There is no like, How about Love Love Love\u2026.I have ordered Six more pairs\u2026I\u2019m a very honest person, and reviews have been stopping me from ordering\u2026Finally My 17 year old said try them if you don\u2019t like you return them\u2026The pain I endure  on a daily is very dibilitating on my feet.,,,","660":"These shoes are very comfortable. I will be buying other colors.","661":"Not the cutest but super comfortable.","662":"i bought a pair to wear around the house and ended up ordering two more pairs. super cute and comfy.","663":"Soft comfortable summer sandals for inside wear.","664":"That it was the right color my daughter wanted","665":"I wear a size 9. Must be a popular size. Wanted blue but had to get brown. They are cushy but very wide.  I have to wear socks to keep them falling off.","666":"Love the softness, but wish I had known it would be a very tight fit. I\u2019m 7 and I got 7 but 7.5 would have maybe fit a bit better","667":"I like the color, and fits me well!Thanks","668":"I do not dislike anything\u2026 these are exactly what I was looking for.","669":"It\u2019s like walking on pillows! So soft & cushioned! Fit perfect & more sturdy & stable than flip flops! I will definitely order other colors!","670":"Very comfortable, not for fashion, made well, size accurate, would purchase again!","671":"The slides itself is comfortable and good but I think they\u2019ve sent me a pair of return because when I took it out of the bag the bottoms of the slides look worn, dirty, and has black spots. Also on the left side front a piece of the slide was chipped off. and I even paid full price too. So disappointed.","672":"True to size and just the right amount of support and cushion.","673":"While these slippers are super soft and \u201ccloud\u201d like, do not believe the true to size claim!My feet are a solid size 7 and these slippers feel like an 8. My whole foot slides to the front of the slipper with at least an inch of space behind my heel. I\u2019m afraid to exchange it for a smaller size which might make it too small.","674":"Me encanta","675":"Love the look and comfort of these slides but the sizing is weird. I\u2019m a standard women\u2019s size 8. I bought size 7.5-8.5 in purple. My toes are squished up against the rim of the sole. I wore them anyways but it was irritating. I kept them to give away and ordered a pair of yellow in the next size up. They are huge. I measured them against my Dad\u2019s foot. He wears men\u2019s 10 and these would fit him. Even the strap is much looser. So, I gave up on this brand and bought the 2 strap plus rear strap version in another brand and they fit perfectly.","676":"I love these slippers they are so comfortable! I recommend 10\/10. I ordered the blush color. I\u2019m getting ready to buy purple also!","677":"Feels like walking on a pillow.","678":"I ordered this style of shoe from 3 different brands because the first pair i ordered (from another brand) wasn\u2019t comfy! And im 9 months pregnant looking for a comfy slipper sandal before baby comes. I was so happy when this Bronax brand one came because they were by far the comfiest! Definitely the ones I was going to keep. However, mine came with a big dent in the shoe :\/ so im going to return them and get another pair that\u2019s hopefully in better condition. Maybe 3 stars is a little harsh, but it\u2019s just really a bummer and an inconvenience to do the whole return process and wait for another pair where baby could come any day.So bottom line, would i recommend this sandal, yes!! so comfy.But my shoe definitely had a manufacturer flaw that should have been caught as for as quality control goes.","679":"Looking for quick comfortable slide , The size said mens\/ womens  too big for women of size indicated","680":"Very comfortable and nice colour but way too small. I ordered size 9-10 and they are more like a size 8.","681":"I love them, so comfy!","682":"Super comfy! In my opinion these look great with athleisure. Would definitely repurchase in a few other colors.","683":"Didn\u2019t have my size. I bought a size up. Wish I would not have.","684":"So happy with this purchase. I never never write reviews but my feet are in heaven!!","685":"Best slides ever. Threw my old cheap ones out and this was the best decision I\u2019ve made","686":"","687":"These are very comfortable and soft. You will not get blisters. I wear around house, and outside of house on the porch and patio. You can wear with socks as well, because they have plenty of room. My only complaint is they are very wide, so you do not want to walk down the street in them, or your foot may slide out.","688":"I love these slippers, I have worked in them,  played them. love them.","689":"They are so comfortable I stand up all day and it\u2019s taking all the pressure off of my feet and legs","690":"It's wider that I would like but comfortable.","691":"This product is very comfortable and will be great for the pool or shower.  I have feet that need more support than what these offer for other than brief uses at the pool or shower.  Extremely comfortable and useful for someone with no problems with their feet!","692":"Got these because my apartment is a loft style with industrial, unsealed concrete floors. Killer on the feet. Not to mention I cannot keep them clean.Anyone who watches kdramas knows these are a must. They keep your home clean, and they're so comfy to wear around the house.These are beyond squishy, cloudlike, and sturdy. They don't feel cheap. If you're looking for something slim though, these are on the \"chunky\" side.Anyway, I love the color options. The tan I purchased is quite aesthetic.My neighbors are all jealous. I know it. So buy these and be cooler than your lame neighbors.","693":"These are my house shoes.  They are cushy and comfortable.  I like them.","694":"I was so excited when I first received these they felt great at first but then starting hurting my feet, absolutely no support","695":"Insanely comfy a little squeaky but I love them more than my crocs! Gonna get more.","696":"Best summer comfort shoe.","697":"Soft, cushiony shoes. Good for kicking around the house and yard. Fit as expected","698":"Keep them out of the Sun and heat too for that matter.. left mine in the car not under direct sunlight and they are atleast 3 sizes to small!! It\u2019s funny but I definitely hate that I\u2019ve got to buy a whole new pair !","699":"These are the most comfortable shoes i have ever worn. It literally feels like you\u2019re walking on a cloud. Mine did shrink a little when i left them out in the sun for too long, other than that the best shoes ever.","700":"They are wonderful but sizes do vary from each one.  But, very comfortable.","701":"I got these because my feet hurt. These are probably the most comfortable shoes I own! Love them.","702":"I have plantar fasciitis and these make it so much better!!!","703":"These literally feel like you have clouds on your feet! I bought a pair for my husband; may buy them for the entire family for Christmas!I recommended these to friends and their biggest complaint was they were too wide for narrow feet. I have never purchased wide-fit shoes before, so would consider mine average.","704":"Very comfortable. Like walking in a cloud. The sizing is off. The shoe is too big but so soft I didn\u2019t want to return.","705":"These shoes are cushy and somewhat warm to me.","706":"im an 8.5\/9 and bought the 9-10 to be safe. I think id rather have a size down. I wanted some softer house shoes because our tile floors kill my feet. ngl, theyre pretty ugly, but comfy! kindof like crocs..","707":"Burks\u2026 WHACK- Crocks.. WHACK- Nike Slides\u2026 WHACK- Cloud slides.. Tight asf. I bought a pair then bought a pair for my gf and she is obsessed so she bought a pair for her sister and I just bought another pair for my Best friend. I would 10\/10 recommend these for everyone. I didn\u2019t know this level of comfort existed. You are missing out if you are even hesitating to buy. Just go for it. You will not regret it.","708":"love the color, comfort & fit","709":"I tried on my fianc\u00e9s sisters slippers (brown) and I loved them. So I ordered the black ones. They were smaller than what the size should have been and they were hard! I was so sad.I ended up returning them and getting the brown ones, and they are soft and comfortable, I love them so much!*Avoid the black ones!*","710":"I\u2019ve had these for about a month now. First off these are super comfy! I had injured my foot just as these arrived and they were a godsend!I\u2019m a women\u2019s size 5.5-6 and I ordered the size 4.5-5.5 and they were a little big, which I think is on purpose because they instruct you to wear 2 pairs of socks then use a hairdryer to mold it to your foot shape. However I\u2019ve not yet done this because they\u2019re so comfy as they are I just haven\u2019t got around to it!","711":"They are so comfortable. They actually have great support. So ugly they are adorable!","712":"Super comfy. Hope that lasts. They are a lot wider than I\u2019d hoped, so they look pretty bulbous. I was hoping I could wear them out but they\u2019re kinda clown looking. I\u2019d give a 2 star on looks but a 5 (so far) on comfort - so I gave 4 stars to be fair - can\u2019t give half stars it deems. They looked less wide and cuter in other peoples pix and video. Can\u2019t beat how they feel though. I\u2019ll keep them.","713":"Fabulous","714":"Travels easy walk comfortable","715":"So soft and squishy and feels like walking on a cloud. Maybe a tiny bit small? But fits me perfectly","716":"I really wanted a pair because I'd heard they were so comfortable...I. normally a size 10...I purchased the 9.5-10.5 and the footed was to short..I then ordered the 10.5-11.5 and while the foot bed was perfect, the band across the top was way too big...I had to return them too...","717":"OK I wouldn\u2019t wear these in public really but they are fantastic around the house. The size is big but I think they\u2019re supposed to be like that. They are very comfortable when doing house work and taking your dogs for a walk","718":"Looks big","719":"I\u2019m very picky about shoes I wear because of back problems. These are so comfortable and feel great on my feet! So far I haven\u2019t had back pain from them. They seem very durable even though I\u2019ve only had them a short time. I can\u2019t see them falling apart anywhere. I love them so much I\u2019m going to buy my whole family a pair!","720":"I normally wear a 5.5\/6 so ordered the size for 4-5.5. They were huge both width wise and lengthwise. I gave them to a friend who is a size 8 and they fit her perfectly.","721":"I just took these out and these are hella comfy. I never wrote a review before. But yeo these are so good. I also get extra height >:0They\u2019re like a foam texture and they curve in the right places for your foot.Top part that covers your foot seems a little thin but overall these don\u2019t feel like they\u2019ll break too soon. Nice stuff","722":"Very comfortable but not very dressy. Good casual or pool shoes.","723":"I ordered my shoe size (8) and they are too small","724":"Super comfy!!!","725":"Don't think twice. Listen, if you don't want to wear them in public, they make EXCELLENT house shoes. They seriously are so pillowy. I wear them as house shoes and they feel like they're taking pressure off my flat feet. Plus, I think they're extremely cute.","726":"I wear an 8.5 shoe so I ordered the 7.5-8.5 and it was soo close to fitting but was too small. The back of my foot was resting on the \"lip\" of the back of the shoe which was uncomfortable. I ordered the next size up from a different brand, literally same shoe, and it was too large. Unfortunately these just don't work for me.","727":"After a few months a hard impression of my foot was made and it wasn't nearly as comfy. I still wear them but I wish they could have stayed as soft as when they were new for longer. For the price they are pretty good. When I first got them they were absolutely \ud83d\udcaf","728":"This slides fit perfect and they are so comfortable! I wear them everywhere. Highly recommend.","729":"The fit","730":"These shoes are so comfortable! If you are looking for slides, they are fantastic!","731":"These slides were comfortable but did not work for my wide\/flat foot.  Had to return.","732":"Love these. Very comfy!","733":"Wear everyday","734":"I would probably rate these 3 1\/2 stars, but since I will probably end up not wearing these much I'll give it 3.  It may be 4 or 5 for others though (see reason below).I wanted a sandal\/slipper I could wear inside and decided to try these.The good:  Good fit and comfortable.  The sole is made of a thick kind of bouncy material.  Similar to those standing mats.The bad:  This may not affect others, but since the sandal material doesn't really breathe, it makes my feet sweaty if I don't wear them with socks.  I had intended to wear them during hot weather as well, but don't think I will now.So I guess if you aren't affected by sweaty feet (or always wear socks)  I would highly recommend them.  If sweaty feet don't sound great, I would half recommend them.  I like them with socks, but not great without them.","735":"They aren\u2019t durable but for the money they\u2019re not bad.","736":"Birthday gift. My 40 yr old son loves them!!!","737":"Ordered these in black to wear around the house and to the pool. Soles feel cushy and provide some decent support, though I have to consciously shift my weight off my heels, otherwise My foot ends up in a flexed position which gets uncomfortable after a while. My biggest two bugaboos are 1) the material used, while soft, does end up rubbing the sides of my foot to the point my skin turns red. If I had to wear these all day, I\u2019d definitely get a raw spot on my foot. 2) these shrink is the sun. I was outside relaxing in the summer sun and when I went to slide these back on they were noticeably smaller all around. They are borderline too small to continue wearing. Keep them out of the sun.","738":"Comphy","739":"These sandals are really comfortable!","740":"I bought these as a bet. They arrived stiff & uncomfortable.  But...they steadily got softer, as they fit my feet better.  I've lost the bet.  I'd buy again.","741":"Needed these slides to give my toes some expanded room recently- these fit the bill, literally.","742":"Super soft! They feel amazing!","743":"Very comfortable, but far too wide for narrow feet. Wish I had had these when I was pregnant!  \ud83e\udd23","744":"I ordered a womens 9-10. I am usually a 9 or 9.5. These were huge. On the bottom of the shoe it says 40-41 which is a womens 10-11. I will be reordering a couple sizes down because they were so cute and comfortable","745":"Super bouncy and comfy but not really supportive. I wear them almost every day, though. These definitely have more squish then some of the cloud slides I've seen at the store. Beware the olive green is not green at all, more of a baby poop color.","746":"I wear size 6 in women (US). The size I bought was too big and so I bought a size smaller and they were almost too small. So they should make a wider range of sizes for feet. They\u2019re very soft & it felt like I was standing on a foam cloud when I first tried them on. Having said that, it doesn\u2019t have much support for your foot bc of how soft and being that they are an inch thick.","747":"The best dupe not stiff at all. Size up","748":"I wore them a day before pics so you\u2019ll see they\u2019re a little dirty, not to be unexpected wort the light color.  But I love them!  They do feel like clouds.  For the price, I plan to get another color or two.  Great for summer errands, activities with the kids, or just walking around the house.  Big fan.I tried to take  a picture of how squishy but thick they are.  Feels very supported in standing.","749":"I have three pairs of these shoes by 3 manufacturers.  Ordered the same size.  These are way bigger and will have to be worn only inside or with socks.","750":"Fit was a little too big but overall satisfied","751":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0Las recomiendo est\u00e1n s\u00faper c\u00f3modas \ud83e\udd70 soy 7 y hagarre 6\/7 \ud83e\udd70","752":"I am so shocked at how soft and almost bouncy these shoes are. They are so comfortable and don't get sticky on a hot summer day. I would highly recommend!","753":"Bought these for the wife, she loves them and is buying in different colors.  Most comfortable house shoe she says have ever been on her feet.","754":"Girl girl I would not lie to you they are fantastic when I put my foot in these I knew they were the truth. They literally fit your feet like they been carved into your skin. I am so happy and so please I am going to order all colors and that is definite","755":"They are comfortable but way too wide for most women","756":"I found the length to be OK but the width was about an inch too wide for my foot. I normally wear a medium width. These would be more suitable for somebody with a very wide foot.","757":"You might ask if my feet are the same size\u2026 They are. It feels like the right one is just a touch larger.I love the look & the price & the way they\u2019re so well cushioned.","758":"I am really enjoying these slides. I wear the around the house all day. They were just what I was looking for.","759":"Runs big but Really comfy cuteGot a 7\/8","760":"These will be worn indoors only. They are comfortable but they make your feet look H U G E. Really unflattering. I probably could have sized down but not sure that would have helped!","761":"Lo \u00fanico que hago notar es que compr\u00e9 una talla m\u00e1s grande","762":"Love the feel and weight.  Definitely great buy for the price and get asked all the time if they are the expensive brand!  My new go to house shoe!","763":"I have plantar fasciitis and I have a size 13 foot and weigh 255 pounds. These literally feel like clouds my family loves them and will be purchasing them. I might purchase a brown pair.","764":"These run SMALL. I wear a size 9 womens (sometimes even 8.5) so I got the 9-10 womens and my heel hangs off the edge. HOW are these supposed to fit a size 10 women\u2019s foot? There\u2019s no way. I\u2019m disappointed. But my husband got his size (12 men) and they fit him. They are super comfy, I just wish they fit better :(","765":"Best slides ever.","766":"Really comfy","767":"I really wanted to like the shoes. They were very comfortable,  but I had to return the shoes. They were very wide. I which they had a narrow version","768":"Absolutely love these!!! So comfortable, I wear them ALL the time! The lavender color is so pretty and exactly as pictured. My new fav shoes!","769":"Should let you know in the listing that they are wide very wide I wear a size 9 at the same slippers from a different company and they are perfect these are just way too big not safe to be wearing them","770":"They look kind of silly as shoes but they are actually really comfortable! I wear them more than my slippers which I always wore walking around the house. Surprisingly more comfortable than I expected too. Don't make my feet hurt at all. Love them and the color purple!Ordered them in black a few months after and they gave me a smaller size even though I ordered the exact same size. It wasn't comfortable at all. Size variation in it is that you'll get the one size or the other it seems not that it fits those sizes. Must have gotten the purple in the bigger size range and the black in the smaller size range.","771":"Love these wear them every day around the house outside in the lake to the market they are awesome.  Feels like pillows on your feet","772":"My knees didn't hurt while wearing around the house but there isn't any arch support and it makes my plantar fasciitis flair up.  If you have any kind of foot problems I would look for something with more support.  Not real durable for walking around.  I've had them for a month and they are already starting to compress a bit.  If you can afford it, buy something like Oofos instead if you have knee and foot pain","773":"These are my new go to slides after standing on concrete for 10hrs a day in duty boots feels like I'm walking on cotton. If anyone has sore feet I strongly recommend these slides","774":"I'm the type of person who doesn't like getting things stuck of my feet so i wanted a pair of slippers for around the house. These are great. The material is like soft plastic like with crocs just without the crocs price tag. It's also great for those with wide feet or foot\/ankle injuries thay may habe altered the shape of their foot. I wear a size 9 and ordered a size 9 and it fits fine.","775":"Really lite and comfortable going to buy another pair with a different color.","776":"I'm pleasantly surprised at how comfortable these are--even without the arch support.  I would buy these again.","777":"I bought these for my husband fingers crossed that he would be into them. They are totally different from anything I have ever put on the man\u2019s body so I was a bit nervous. The height of the sole is an open table discussion\/ throw down over her lol! He loved everything about them he said to me! The lowest in cash yet the best in satisfaction! I was told that they are the most comfortable ones I have ever bought him! The fit was right on he\u2019s a 10.5 I followed the reviews and then the chart. Thank goodness I have found a good looking paint of summer slippers for my Love that easily!","778":"These truly feel like walking on clouds. Even my ugg slippers aren\u2019t as comfortable. Best money spent in a while. Just be mindful it runs a bit wide so if you don\u2019t have wide feet it\u2019ll just feel loose. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d suggest sizing down though because the front to back fits pretty true to size.","779":"They\u2019re so comfortable I have two pair I use one pair as shower shoes and second one wear them throughout the house.","780":"I love it","781":"Bought 4 slides the softness not the same . I have to return 1 . Ordered 1 in a different color i hope it will be softer like my other slipper.","782":"These shoes are very comfortable and lightweight. I read the reviews which said that they run small and to order the next size up, this was not the case for me, so now I have a larger outdoor shoe and a just right I door shoe.","783":"Definitely recommend.I bought this pair for my son who often complains of foot pain towards the end of the day due to his overproduction. He's found these to be super comfortable and ease his foot pain.They fit nicely but rub a tad small. He wears a 10.5 so I got the 10-11 size and he's wearing them from tip to toe.","784":"Love these for the house. Very comfortable. But I would not wear them out f the house because they look foolish.","785":"Like the ease of putting them on, the cushion, n the color!","786":"I absolutely LOVE these. My husband and I are definitely going to buy more colors! The comfort is phenomenal.","787":"Better than anticipated.","788":"So comfortable and love the look but bad support. Like stepping in a cloud. Can\u2019t wear out and about. More of a house slipper.","789":"Super comfy, but no arch support. I wear them for casual everyday wear.","790":"These are so comfortable and squishy. I have an expensive pair of Nike slides and these are hands-down the most comfortable slides ever. If you're on the fence because of the style or look, I have been wearing these for a few weeks and wear any other ones yet.","791":"Very comfortable however I thought they would be bright yellow and they are a soft pale yellow.","792":"It's very comfortable but runs a bit big","793":"I got my normal size in these and I wished I had sized up. My foot fits just right and I wished they were a little bigger on me, as I had expected them to be. Other than that, I love them and wear them often!","794":"These slides are so soft and comfy!!! I feel like I\u2019m walking on a cloud!","795":"Omg I finally caved and tried a pair and they are soooo comfy!! I normally wear a womens 10\/11 and I got the womens 10.5:\/11.5 and they fit great! The strap is a little big (and I don\u2019t have narrow feet) otherwise they fit perfectly!I don\u2019t expect them to hold up past the summer. But for the price I paid I don\u2019t even mind :)","796":"I wear women\u2019s size 12 and ordered the 12 Dash 13. I figured they would be on the large side. They were in fact on the small side. My heel and toe reached beyond the raised edge of the foot bed.","797":"They fit way too small, I had to give it to my mom who has smaller feet than me. She said it\u2019s comfortable for a while, but eventually causes feet pain. Good as house slippers.","798":"I ordered a size 9\/10 in women's, because I wear a 9 in women's. They were too small. The size chart says the manufacturer size for 9\/10 is 40-41 and that's what's on the bottom of the shoe. But they're too small. Where's the true sizing chart???","799":"I needed a pair of house slippers that I could be on my feet all day with. These did not disappoint! I have high arches so I feel pain after a couple of hours with no support. I\u2019ll be ordering more!","800":"They are comfortable but they do rub and gives blister on top of foot.","801":"Very comfortable. I wear around the house, may get another pair","802":"I like the slide but I wear a size 11 women's shoes. It was not long enough for me. Otherwise this is a very good show.","803":"I am a size 7 in women's shoes and I'm generally very true to size. I ordered the 7-8 size of these and they barely fit, my toes and heels are at the edge of these shoes. Would definitely recommend sizing up if you're on the higher end of the size.","804":"I had high hopes for these Sandles\/slippers. They appeared to be the closest to a pair that I live in but have finally worn out\u2026.made by Hounds. That company has apparently gone out of business. Anyway, the fit and feel of the \u201cCloud\u201d slides is completely different. The are so bulky and not supportive that I immediately tripped while wearing them the first time. The main issue is that I have large bunions on  both feet and unfortunately the strap of these slides hit on them, making them uncomfortable. I will be returning them.","805":"I would purchase again!","806":"My God these are so soft. So comfy. Like pillows and clouds. I have little money, but will be buying another pair.","807":"These slides are so soft & comfortable for standing.  I did not do well walking in them for more than just around my house. Attempting to walk several blocks and on the beach, priced very difficult. I\u2019ll be using them as house shoes!","808":"This shoe is super cushiony and soft to wear!","809":"These shoes feel like you are walking around on a mattress topper.  My sister got a pair and went on and on about how comfy they are.  She was right.  You can wear them around the house, to the pool or beach, to run errands.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever put on a more comfortable shoe\/slide.","810":"Have you ever wanted to experience walking on clouds?Search no further.I\u2019m a nurse.I work long shifts.These shoes are heavenly and look cute.Love them.","811":"Can\u2019t wait to wear them.","812":"It\u2019s large for me.","813":"Amazingly comfy but runs very small. Size up!!!","814":"Liked everything about these slides.","815":"A sturdy,comfortable shoe with surprising support and protection for the foot. Pillow-soft!","816":"I normally wear a 9.5 shoe and bought a size 10 which is a bit small.  Prime day purchase","817":"These were okay. They will serve their purpose around the house and at the beach, but they are a little snug for someone whose feet truly are a standard size seven. They\u2019re not as soft\/cushiony as I hoped either.","818":"These are SO comfortable. I have now purchased these in red, bright pink, tan, white and black. I usually prefer going barefoot but lately I find myself forgetting to kick these off. My husband has to check me sometimes because I have left the house without changing into my dress\/work shoes. I can\u2019t recommend these enough. I have a medium width foot and these run true to size.","819":"Oh my goodness these are so comfortable! They are so soft when you walk! They are one of the best slides I\u2019ve had! They do run small so I ordered one size up and it fits perfectly. They are like walking on marshmallows! If you have tired feet at the end of the day you need these! Love them!!!","820":"Very soft and confortable","821":"If you have problems with pain in your feet these shoes are simply amazing!","822":"i ordered my normal size but they were too big and too lose so i ordered the MIA ones in the same size and they were so much better than these","823":"I\u2019ve been having on\/off pain in my heel and ankle for several years and these are so great for that and my flat feet.  I wear these all around my apartment and have had little to no pains since getting these.  These are way softer and wider across my foot then the ones sold at Target.  Try these if you have flat feet or heel and ankle pains.","824":"I love these shoes because they are super comfortable and supportive . Buyers beware-they are nothing like the knockoffs at the stores. After you blow dry the top, it molds perfectly to your foot.","825":"Best things I\u2019ve ever put on my feet. If I could get away with it I\u2019d wear these with a ball gown!!","826":"Wow, the comfort is so nice. My feet do sweat in them though, so i can see how I could easily get blisters if I wore them too long","827":"Very comfortable!!","828":"These have exceeded my expectations. I have had similar slides in the past and were not thrilled with them but decided to get more because they are just convenient. They feel like you are walking on a cloud. I will be getting more in different colors. 10\/10 would recommend!!","829":"Incredibly soft. I can imagine wearing them to the hospital when I give birth but I probably wouldn\u2019t wear them any other time truthfully.","830":"Comfortable!","831":"These are the PERFECT shoes! I struggle with bunions, plantar fasciitis!! I have to wear shoes around the house because I have hard floors and so many problems with my feet has listed I highly recommend these shoes! My son won't wear his crocs anymore he's 12 years old and he's still the shoes for me so now I'm back on here were to order him some and I decided to write a review in the process.","832":"My feet dont hurt after a long day anymore","833":"These shoes aren\u2019t the most flattering, but they are SOO COMFORTABLE! Great shoes for around the house.","834":"Era un regalo para mi esposa, est\u00e1 encantada por la calidad del producto.","835":"These are so comfortable and make you feel so supported and cushioned as you walk. Seriously the best slides I\u2019ve tried. I wear a size 7.5 usually and I got the size 6-7 and they still have a lot of space so they definitely run large. I highly recommend these!","836":"Comfortable fits perfectly","837":"I'm totally in love with these slides! I am just recovering from a foot & leg injury, and my boot was causing hip pain and after two months I couldn't take the boot any longer. When I wear these slipper shoes, I can walk, be on my feet for long periods. Zero pain. My feet and legs do not swell at all. It was amazing. When I wear tennis shoes my feet and ankles swell badly, and not cheap shoes at all. I just bought myself and my daughter a pair and can't wait to have a new color! So supportive! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! I would love other options than a slide or slipper. OH, I also don't slip on my tile, which is how I fell and injured myself.","838":"I just love it","839":"So comfy, I want them in every color!!!","840":"Loved them at first.  Little loose on my narrow feet but ok. After a day at the beach. They shrunk like 2 sizes","841":"I bought these for myself about a month ago to wear around the house as slippers.  My 12 year old son quickly took them over and said he can't believe how comfy they are so I ordered him a pair.  He has been living in them ever since.  So much more comfortable than traditional slides or flip flops.  Will definitely be ordering in other colors as well.","842":"Comfy","843":"I\u2019ve ordered my wife 3 pair, first pair was perfect, the 2nd and 3rd pair were easily an inch shorter. We compared both to the first order by placing them sole to sole. They are very comfortable, but apparently the factory had a different run of these that were a little off. I\u2019d recommend, but watch the sizing.","844":"Soo comfortable! I enjoy wearing them around the house and to run errands.","845":"Awesome","846":"So comfy and I would recommend these shoes for anyone. Perfect summer shoe!","847":"Seemed comfortable but were too big, I ordered 9-9.5 size but couldn't keep them on. Size down if you want a good fit.","848":"I love them. BUT! I wore them out to our pool. (Hot Vegas). Swam 2 hours. They were pretty toasty so I dunked them into the pool (have gotten them wet before) anyways. I just needed to get back inside the house. They felt weird. Fast forward 3 hours later. About to run an errand. They didn\u2019t fit. I have small feet size 7. They now fit my 8 year old daughter. She is a 1. Shrunk to maybe a youth size 2! \ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd2f(SEE PIC. THE WHITE ONES ARE A DIFFERENT BRAND BUT STILL A SIZE 7. CRAZY HOW MUCH THE BLACK ONES SHRUNK! Right?!!!!)","849":"Slipons  are very comfortable if they fit your foot properly. These were a little too narrow for me and not comfortable.","850":"Much bulkier than I imagined for what I was looking for in a slip-on shoe","851":"These slides are ROUGH! I ordered my usual size 10 in these and have been wearing them for a few weeks, they are bulky and slightly big, and the texture is so prominent that the shoes hurt my bare feet. I have been getting blisters from each wear. They are nice and thick with some spring in your step, but you have to wear them with socks for any comfort. Going to return and continue the search!","852":"Not as soft as the original.","853":"I have wanted to try these slides for over a year. Then I received them as a gift for Mother's Day! They are so cute and comfy. The sizing is more like Birkenstock, so size down. I take a size 7 (US), but needed these in a size 35-36. After a few exchanges I realized this, but their customer service was amazing and fast!!","854":"They\u2019re super chunky and the color does not compliment my skin. But they\u2019re comfy.","855":"Never felt a more comfortable slide It\u2019s like wearing a sneaker and a cute comfy sandal all at once!! Love these so much.","856":"Comfortable","857":"I was worried my tiny feet would swim in them but the 4-5.5 is more like a classic Chinese 5. They fit perfectly! I did do the odd hair dryer trick but without socks because I wanted to mold to my actual foot, not a socked foot which is larger. It worked! The top hugs my feet, I don't flop out of them , and OH how soft and cushy they are. I probably wouldn't want to walk miles because there isn't support as far as an arch goes, or ankle. Amazing for around the house, the pool, quick errands. I'm excited to put them on everyday! I'll probably order another pair in purple. The sage and beige are similar in color, so beware of that. Order these NOW , you'll thank me:)","858":"These are way better than expected. After a long day and my feet hurt, I slip into these and my feet thank me. Lol My wife and son want a pair now.","859":"To slip on when going outdoors to water","860":"Wanted to give them a 5 star rating but due to this one problem, I couldn\u2019t. I really wanted to love these and would have if it weren\u2019t for them not fitting great. The foot size was true to fit however the part that goes over the top of your foot was to loose. My foot would go to far up when walking which caused my toes to hurt since I was trying to keep my foot from moving forward to far. Other than that they were soft and comfortable but the strain on my toes was more than I could handle. I thought about going down to the size under that however since the area my foot fits into was perfect I think the next size down would be to small. Have to return them unfortunately. \ud83d\ude1e","861":"Just got them wasnt too sure but omg its like walking on pillows i just had ankle surgery and shoes horrible to wear these are amazing going to get more colors plan on living in them! They\u2019re a MUSTLoved them so much got second pair in blush and again amazing haven\u2019t taken them off since i got them omg so comfy!","862":"Fun to wear, but risky for me to trip and fall. It\u2019s like walking on marshmallows.","863":"It was a smidge small. No arch support but soft.","864":"Bought these because so many people online recommended. Was not comfy for me at all. Returned.","865":"This pair is softer than the two patterned pair I bought of same brand. These are very comfortable and fitting to my foot sole. My new summer shoe no question.","866":"Comfortable good price","867":"For quite some time I have used Birkenstock Arizona sandals as my indoor and causal outdoor shoe. This has now supplanted them as my go to indoor shoe and we as going out to our pool. The cushion is great and it's fun to walk around anthem. The $24 price tag is attractive also. My wife now loves them also.","868":"The one is too big because they stuff one inside the other for packaging.","869":"I have a black pair of these, and I wear them constantly.  I live in the country, so I purchased these to run around with outside.  Easy to just slip on fits very well, so I was a little disappointed that these ended up being to small.  I can get my foot in them but very tight.  I didn't send them back because I waited to long.  I am just going to try and stretch them out here and there.  Like I said my black ones we're and are great I wouldn't give them up for nothing","870":"They fit perfectly and true to size. I was worried they would be too big based on other reviews, but they weren\u2019t.","871":"I got these for my mom who has a lot of numbness, and foot & leg pain, mostly due to diabetes. She absolutely loves these, and bought several more pairs!She stated  that after wearing for a day, she had zero pain, no swelling, and  even the numb feeling was a lot better.  So far, these have helped improve  her mobility, which helps so much with her quality of life.  I highly recommend!!!","872":"The shoes were great, I left them in the sun for about 20 minutes and they shrunk! A whole size! So my advice, don\u2019t leave them in the sun!","873":"i would give these slippers a 5 out of 5 since they\u2019re comfortable and do exactly what they\u2019re supposed to. however every time i walk around my house in these i shock myself on metal doorknobs, light switches, and metal sink faucets when i go to wash my hands. i don\u2019t understand the science behind it. i mean i know if you rub your feet on carpet you can shock someone but i have no carpet and the static shock doesn\u2019t happen to me when i\u2019m not wearing them. when my mom wears these she says the same thing happens to her. we have regular vinyl tiled floors. i\u2019ve zapped my poor cat trying to pet her after wearing these around my house. our other older slippers and sandals we own don\u2019t do this. what gives?","874":"I have unreasonably wide feet that look swollen 9\/10. So I took a risk and bought these and I\u2019m SO GLAD I DID!! I have a high arch at the top of my foot that causes issues with most slides but these are amazing. I\u2019m about to buy another pair when I get paid. I wear them with everything, and the comfort is unreal. \ud83e\udd79","875":"These are the best thing I have ever found for my tired aching feet... Seriously like walking on a spongy cloud. Feel so good at the end of the day I ordered another pair and one for my husband. He tried them on and said Whoa!!! Hasn't taken them off when he's home since. Buy these - you won't be sorry :)","876":"","877":"Size up and they shrink in the sun. And they cut my side of the foot because they\u2019re tight . Wear socks first week or two","878":"I bought these after seeing them trend on tik tok and I am not disappointed!!! The previous Jesus sandals were always too hard IMO but they really are great shoes to wear at home and after work. It perfectly supports your feet and they are also very easy to clean! They do not look cheap and the product overall is great!Side note though: I would personally size a half size down when you buy them. I usually wear a 7.5 (rarely but sometimes an 8) and I bought my first pair in the 7-8.5 and they were too big but I was able to immediately send them back and bought the size under and they fit perfectly! I received my replacement and basically even exchange within 2 days!","879":"Ordered the olive green. The color is great to go with my camouflage pants and shorts. I\u2019ve gotten similar sandals from other vendors these seem a little better quality than my white and gray pairs. They also seemed like they might be a little more durable but time will tell. These are good for quick errands, beach , backyard etc. . Don\u2019t think I would want to use them for all day on your feet activities. Maybe if I was 20 something. I am happy with my purchase.","880":"Like walking on a cloud. Great option to the more expensive brand that starts with an \u201cO\u201d (I\u2019ve owned both) Great for recovery after workouts or just walking around the house in. I will buy several for nice inexpensive gifts","881":"When I got this I was baffled at all the reviews saying it was like walking on a pillow. These were super hard and I was ready to return them. I decided to try to wear them in and after a few days of wearing them I can finally see what the reviews meant. It\u2019s super comfortable and they fit true to their size.I\u2019m a person who really wear sandals as I find them uncomfortable and prefer to just walk barefooted but I\u2019ve been using these on a regular. I\u2019ve had a couple of people ask me what are they as it looks comfortable.","882":"My husband where\u2019s them for slippers around the house. He has bad ankles he is conforterble in them.","883":"I have really sensitive feet that cramp up a lot. Wearing these are like walking on a cloud","884":"Just know your heart might palpitate cause you might trip a few times.","885":"wish it didn't come damaged because i Loved these sandals. Had to return them","886":"So these are the best but DON\u2019T wear them by the pool. I put them on with my feet, slightly wet, then they sat in the sun and SHRUNK! Other than that I loved them but now they are like two sizes too small from the heat, I guess! Super sad about it.","887":"So soft and comfortable. Im wearing them most of the day.","888":"Too wide for narrow feet. Had to return.","889":"So comfortable and soft! I have gotten many compliments on them. I also like that they give a bit of height. If only they fit better. They run too large.","890":"These slides are so comfortable! I\u2019ve had them for about 2 months now, and these are hands down my favorite house shoes. My husband has even stolen them because they\u2019re so comfy lol. Will definitely buy again!PS Walmart sells a version of the cloud slippers as well, but they do not come close when it comes to comfort!","891":"Amazing comfort. Super light and I can wear them everywhere and just hop in the shower with them to clean them off!","892":"Bought these little guys for vacay, sooo comfy, my husband thought so as well. After a month and a half they did tear in the corner. If it wasn\u2019t for the tear so early I would have given them 5 stars.  Right outside of the return window, gutted. Beautiful color","893":"I love them because they are soft and comfortable.","894":"Possibly best for smaller folk. As a size 18 woman, I think these are too soft. They sink in the heal, which makes my lower back hurt. I only purchased for inside the house, for extra comfort while cooking or cleaning for example. But they caused more discomfort after using for like an hour while cooking. Don\u2019t recommend if your even a little overweight.","895":"They are just perfect!","896":"I liked the fact that they were cushy. I had a problem keeping them on my feet.","897":"These are crazy comfortable. It's like memory foam except it doesn't squish down to nothing. My only negative is that I really don't like the color (olive green), it's kind of a weird khaki color, but that's just a personal preference and to be fair the picture is pretty accurate, I was just hoping it'd be more green. I would return and get another color but since I'm just wearing them around the house I don't care enough. I've found walking around the house barefoot is making my feet sore so I'm trying these. I need to shrink them a bit with the hair dryer, and I think its great you have that option. This is only Day 1 but there's a good chance I'll be buying another pair soon.","898":"I love the support it gives! My only complaints are that my true size is not secure enough on my foot. I will have to size down. They are also very noisy on tile. It\u2019s hard to stay silent when trying to sneak around the house in the late hours of the night.","899":"I thought I was doing well ordering once size up based on some other reviews but I should have gone two sizes up. If they were slightly bigger, I think I\u2019d love them.","900":"True to size. Buy your normal size. Mine got little bigger over time but still I like it. My boys always tries to steal it whenever I\u2019m not wearing them \ud83d\ude02. Wish this comes in kid\u2019s size too. My husband loves this too but he doesn\u2019t want to get one because he usually don\u2019t wear slippers inside the house unless it\u2019s too cold!!Anyways my point is, just buy it you will love it","901":"\u2764\ufe0f Super Comfy","902":"Excellent","903":"Love these slippers so comfortable","904":"10\/10 expect they shrink in the sun.","905":"I'm wearing them at work now :)  luv it","906":"Great fit and perfect for skinny feet. I did their blow drying suggestion and made the fit even better. Originally purchased cushionare (big & bulky) and returned them for these. So happy I did","907":"I used these towards the end of my pregnancy to help relieve heal pain and it was great. I\u2019m going to keep wearing them because they are so soft and squishy.","908":"Very comfortable and cute my favorite sandals","909":"They were very comfortable but I kept on trying to keep the right shoe on my foot, it kept sliding backward. So, comfortable, but not comfortable.","910":"This is best $25 I have spent!! They are so soft but not too soft! Thus providing perfect cushion to the back. And I love the material, I can walk outside my home in them and just rinse it with water and they are new again.","911":"Supper comfy","912":"Oh my....my feet are in heaven.  I needed some house shoes as our hard floors are killing my feet. I've been wearing these non stop the past couple of days! So cushy and  comfy. I did heed the other reviews and size slightly down. I'm a women's 7.5 and ordered the 6\/7 size which worked perfectly.","913":"These shoes didn\u2019t work for me. They fit too snug at the front and big at the back. They are very cushioned but no arch support. Returned.","914":"These are high quality, very durable and well made, with comfortable cushioning. If you have normal feet, they'll probably work great. Unfortunately, I have wide feet with bunions, and the plastic strap across my toe joints offered no flex, so the plastic grated against my bunions in a very irritating fashion. Had to return.","915":"Too wide.","916":"I have really jacked up feet from a shattered lower leg. These are pretty comfortable and okay support. The slippers are good but my feet are bad. For around the house they're definitely usable.","917":"I didn\u2019t know what to expect \/ but they looked very comfy in the pic and reviews. Holy cow- they are like walking on a cloud! I haven\u2019t taken them off. We have tile (live in the desert) so my feet get fatigued - however, this slipper is amazing. You would think your feet sweat, it\u2019s been in the 80\u2019s and I\u2019ve not had that at all. Not slippery - just oh! So soft. Love them !","918":"Love my new shoes they really are very soft and form fitting to my foot but doesn\u2019t hold that shape like other shoes. They look big on my foot but they wear well and don\u2019t slide so not sure that matters.  I\u2019ll be getting another color I was wanting when it comes back in stock.","919":"I ordered size as recommended. They would not stay on my feet. Too long AND the support band across the foot was too high. I was tripping over my feet within steps. I have flatter feet and did not reorder since I don\u2019t think having an unadjustable band will work for me. Gave them away to my daughter. Super thick and cushioned foot bed, however.","920":"THE MOST COMFORTABLE SLIPS. MONEY WELL SPENT.","921":"We loved the shoes until they shrunk a full size by sitting on the porch today? So if you get them don't wear them to the beach.","922":"Soft, cushiony me amazingly comfortable!  If you haven\u2019t walked on air\u2026. You will with these.  The fit for me was perfect.","923":"The media could not be loaded.","924":"These sandals are the MOST comfortable pair I\u2019ve used.Recently I bought (and quickly returned) a pair of $50 Birkenstock sandals because of the \u201cbrand\u201d and all the hype.These are half the price and twice the comfort.Don\u2019t throw your money away. Buy these instead.","925":"These are cute and fun to walk around in for a minute, but I wore mine out for a couple hours while running errands today and they left a blister on the top of my foot where the strap rubs. They aren't as comfortable as I was expecting.","926":"Very comfortable!","927":"These did feel comfy and soft but I returned them because they were just too big for my size 11 feet and I could tell they'd eventually slip off me.If they fit you, though, enjoy!","928":"I had foot surgery in March and have not transitioned into a shoe yet.  I bought these to wear around the house.  I use them to walk back and forth to chicken coop and water my plants...if my shoe gets wet, it dries quickly.","929":"I use these as my house shoe. They\u2019re incredibly comfortable and give great support while I\u2019m cooking, cleaning, or just generally on my feet around the house. Definitely worth the buy and would buy again!","930":"I normally wear an 8.5 so the first time I ordered these I went with the (7.5-8.5) and that ended up being too small so I sent them back and got the next size up which is a bit too large for me. They are super comfortable though so I'm keeping the larger size I just wish they fit a little more snug.","931":"Really comfortable however if your feet are the least bit wet, then it\u2019s like waking on slippery ice!!  Literally almost twisted my ankle twice!!","932":"I ordered the fuchsia color and it was true to the pictures. The slippers seem good quality for the price and pretty plushy\/comfortable. I have a wide size 81\/2 foot and sized up which was a mistake since they are a bit big so next time I order these slippers I would size down since the sizing is a bit off.","933":"When looking at them for the first time they look huge, then after putting them on everything is perfect, and just the way recovery shoes should be. I recommend, they are very good","934":"I had to try these slides. I\u2019ve heard that they are so soft on your feet. And they are. It feel like I have pillows on my feet. The only thing I wish was it didn\u2019t make my feet sweat.","935":"Love so comfortable and cute!!!","936":"Soft. Provide excellent arch support for plantar faciiatis. Great value","937":"These are great sandals! I wear an 8.5 and could have went either way with sizing.","938":"These slides have been very popular so I figured I\u2019d finally buy myself a pair and they are amazing. Very comfortable but still cute! I need them in every color","939":"Muy suaves , se las recomiendo","940":"I feel like I am wearing snow shoes, soles are very wide.  Top band is to loose and when my feet sweat in 100% weather I slip and slide all over. I had also ordered another color but canceled as soon as I got the black.","941":"100% satisfied","942":"I love having slides to wear around the house\/easily slide on to take my dog out. These are so comfy. After I ordered mine, my boyfriend wanted a pair so now we both wear them around. Simple, comfortable, and fits true to size.","943":"Love them. Only negative is the other colors in my size were sold out!","944":"These shoes look as if they'd be wonderful.  But they ran way too big, and too wide, making them very very dangerous.  I'm returning them.","945":"Love love love them! Going to buy more colors for sure and I have wide feet they fit wonderful and are so comfortable","946":"What I like about then is very soft.What I didn\u2019t like is the they sink and there Very slippery\ud83d\ude1d","947":"These shoes are comfortable but I was expecting them to be sturdier. Good for around the house not not walking around doing errands. Also they squeak a lot","948":"If you have wide feet these are so not for you I tried so hard to like them but they\u2019re so uncomfortable on the sides of my feet","949":"I use them as house shoes, love them","950":"I have been wearing these around the house every day since the beginning of the pandemic. They are life changing. I can't go anywhere without packing them now. They are also the BEST thing in the world to change into after a workout. It is like walking on a cloud. You will not regret these.","951":"I'm usually a size 8 women's so I ordered 7.5\/8.5 they are way too big","952":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0Love them! You just heat them up with a blow dryer and it shapes to your feet and to your perfect size. They\u2019re like walking on a cloud. I love wearing them in my garden and basically anything I wear. With shorts, jeans, yoga pants. They\u2019re just so cute!","953":"although they seem to run large...got the 7.5\/8, and I usually wear a 7, but these were more like a 9.I was going to return them, and my husband liked them so much (they ARE super comfy, squishy, really nice feeling) he's keeping them, and I'm ordering a smaller size.  I like also that they are molded in one piece, so there are no seams to come apart.","954":"These are the best slippers I have ever had. They don't get flat , have wonderful support, and have many awesome colors. I had bought a pair and had to get another on for the hubby. Don't miss out on these wonderful slippers. Buy them now !","955":"This was too tight across but big for the foot length.  Returned and bought the kind with buckles and like MUCH more.","956":"Love these.  Run a little big though","957":"I ordered 2 different sizes and colors of these \"cloud\" slippers but I found that the bigger size was waayy cushier than the smaller sized one. Why would there a difference? This one, the footbed was firm and not squishy at all. It felt more like a regular shoe\/sandal with little arch support. Disappointed that there's a discrepancy like this.","958":"Comfy, but wish they weren't so wide","959":"I\u2019m kind of shocked how nice they feel. They did come with a small scuff but, it wiped right off. Super soft and comfortable. Definitely would be good for anyone with minor foot issues. <3","960":"These slides are more comfy than Crocs. I\u2019ve tried on other side that look identical to these but the other ones were hard. I highly recommend these slides!!!","961":"Too big which means dangerous","962":"I ordered these in black after seeing one of my favorite influencers (holly) wearing them. I ordered them in black and and when they came, they looked like spare tires . I could literally walk on water with these things and call them my Jesus shoes . Make no mistake, They are ugly \u2026 But they are comfortable and I have bad feet so I\u2019m keeping them !","963":"They are flip flops an just that , almost fell already once","964":"Don't like the textured foot bed. Love the cushion in heels. Helps my plantar fasciitis wearing around the house. Wish I could find insoles for work shoes with heel cushioning like these. My feet are 65 years old and in so much pain from standing all day on the job. Keeping them","965":"Cloud Slides are an appropriate name! I could hardly stand for more than a few hours while I was pregnant and these shoes have made life bearable again. They are worth every penny!","966":"These are really comfortable slipons. I'm on my feet all day and at the end of the night my feet still don't hurt. Wear around the pool and to the beach too.","967":"","968":"My feet are feeling great in them. I don\u2019t like the way these smell though. It is like chemical plastic.","969":"I ordered these because I\u2019ve heard they\u2019re super comfy, which they totally are. My feet feel like I\u2019m walking on a cloud HOWEVER, this wasn\u2019t my smartest buy, I wore these shoes for a few days straight, just around the house. They started wearing differently, I lean more on one leg when I\u2019m standing and now when I walk I feel crooked because one shoe is more worn down than the other which in turn affected my back. I would def recommend these, just not for people with back\/hip\/knee issues","970":"Can\u2019t walk without them","971":"I owe 3 pairs of these pillow slides I totally love these","972":"I love these!","973":"Perfect in comfort and softness!","974":"Purchased these slides for my mom around the house. She does have a wider foot than me and they fit her great a little big but they\u2019re for around the house so no biggie. I\u2019d say if your someone who has trouble finding shoes because your foot is wider these are perfect for you! They\u2019re comfy & light","975":"These slide are the most comfortable shoes that I have ever put on my feet. I am on my feet all day and when I get home and slide these on, my feet feel wonderful. Everyone should have a pair.","976":"These fit perfectly EXCEPT ARE FAR TOO LOOSE\/WIDE.  Other than that pretty comfy, and might fit better with socks, but will wear primarily w\/out them.  Going to try another brand of the same.  Disappointed.","977":"I have literally been wearing these every single day this summer! Perfect for the beach, the pool, gardening, etc. They run TTS, are incredibly comfortable and light! If you\u2019re on the fence I\u2019m telling you they are 100% worth it!!!","978":"These are the only shoes I\u2019ve ever worn that literally NEVER hurt my feet.  Walking around my house and cleaning all day usually leaves my feet aching, but never with these.  Wish I would\u2019ve bought them years ago!","979":"I love these. The only reason I gave it for stars is because I had to return the first pair. Sizing is off.","980":"This is my second pair.  One for outside and one for inside.  Love Love Love.  I will like I am floating and still secure.","981":"These slides fit my foot length wise but these are clearly sized for mens feet. There is so much space between the foot bed and the strap, these flew off my feet when I tried to walk. They\u2019re unwearable. I gave them to my husband and they fit him perfectly\u2026","982":"Nada very comfortable","983":"The first two days was a pain in the toes. After that, this pair fits perfectly. The material used is in good quality. Seems tough enough to last the whole summer season.","984":"Comfy, a little wide for narrower feet but still work!","985":"I was looking for cushy shoes to wear inside the house rather than going barefoot. Also for vacation around the hotel. . I have foot issues so not great for arch support but I knew that going into these. They are perfect for what I want them for. Might be getting more in different colors.","986":"I saw these on the Today show and thought I would give them a try.  Overall, I liked the sandal but it's a unisex size.  I ordered a size 9\/10 since I wear a ten and they were a half inch too long and the top of the sandal was too large.  Just looked like a man's size fit.  I sent them back.  I would consider reordering a smaller size but I will look around for one that is made just for a woman's foot and not a unisex size.  They were very comfortable though.","987":"These are excellent for walking on wet surfaces without sliding, however, the look like pontoons on my feet! I wear them at home for housework like floor mopping","988":"These shoes are so versatile.  I use them for summer house slippers and pool slippers.  If they fall into the pool, no harm done and they float for easy retrieval.  But they could also be used as everyday sandals.","989":"The only reason I gave 3 stars was because they were left on the deck in the sun.  They shrunk and had to be returned.  So, if you are wearing indoors and limited sun then they are great slides!","990":"Wear every day at home. I have three pair. Just don\u2019t know how long they will hold up. Comfy!","991":"I wear 8 and ordered the same size, they fit great. I think the size is true to the size. Feels comfy and soft.","992":"This shoe shrank in the sun..","993":"Like walking on a cloud","994":"These are very comfortable! That\u2019s really not the issue. But if you get wet while wearing these they can become very slippery! They also run large. The sizing is a little odd, I\u2019m not sure if I would go down because they may be too small.","995":"very nice, buy fo sho","996":"At first I was a bit nervous \ud83d\ude2c if it\u2019s not going to be soft! And when I got it I was very satisfied. Definitely going to buy more. For my mom and my aunts. %100 recommend love all the colors it comes in just as the picture very happy with my order.","997":"I like them for around the house or my yard but won't wear while doing much walking because they don't have much support and though lightweight they are bulky.","998":"Very comfortable but runs big in basically all ways - length and width around foot (this part is most bothersome to me).  Color is also not as high quality as I expected.  That said it\u2019s extremely comfortable in terms of padding.","999":"Most comfy ever!!","1000":"I bought these because I\u2019m super pregnant and I needed something cushy and easy to slip on!  I can go all day in these things!  Best amazon purchase this year!","1001":"Husband loves them","1002":"They are comfy. Easy to clean. I wear them in the house and I would wear them running errands and seeing friends and family!","1003":"they ARE wonderfully weird, they're giant, soft but supportive, look silly and I've already ordered a second pair :). fantastic house shoes!  I might wear them to girls night cocktails at a friends place for the weirdness comfort level.  if you're not sure, grab 'em!","1004":"Just get them!!","1005":"Garantizados al 100 muy buena calidad y s\u00faper c\u00f3modos","1006":"I bought these after seeing on the news that had a shopping clip. .  This is my first review ever. I love these and can\u2019t wait to wear to the lake or just running errand. They do feel like a cloud. Unbelievable. I wear crocs and Hey Dudes and these are even better. Wow! \ud83e\udd29","1007":"Bought while pregnant for extra support and very pleased!","1008":"Surprised at how good the fit is. Very comfortable and I love the color. Information sheet in packing suggests how to get the best fit and care for the sandal.","1009":"I normally wear 6.5 and bought 6-7 size. It runs pretty big for me. Sleepers can easily fall as I walk because the cover is too roomy for my feet. I weigh about 115lb, but I feel like this is too cushy for me. Personally wish it had more firm support at the bottom.","1010":"I absolutely loved these! Wore them everywhere. I left them in my car one day and they shrunk and melted on my seat","1011":"It may take a few hours or a day, for you  truly feel the comfort. I am satisfied with my purchase. Support,  comfort and durability mesh together.","1012":"My husband and I love these slippers they're so comfortable it feels like you're walking on clouds \u26c5\ufe0f \ud83d\ude0c \ud83d\ude0d","1013":"So comfortable and the color is perfect.  I want more of these!","1014":"Color was puke brown and didn't match computer screen so we had to return it.","1015":"I am so in love with these shoes!! They are the most comfortable sandals ever! And your feet don\u2019t slide around a lot in them like some others.I am a women\u2019s size 11. I got 10.5 to 11.5. I was worried they\u2019d be a little big but they fit great!I now have to buy more pairs!","1016":"I thought these shoes were going to be my saving grace, but they are super soft and spongey but didn't provide enough support for my feet.  I wore them shopping for a couple of hours and by the time I got home my feet were killing me.","1017":"Since my feet are narrow it is a bet roomy for me but, I have decided to keep them cause I found them to be comfortable","1018":"I've only had these for a brief time, but the comfort level is right on point. They fit my narrow feet fine, and there was no need to use a hair dryer for a tighter fit. I don't know how they'll last, but I'm pleased with the product. If you're looking for comfy slip-ons to replace slippers, these are a win.","1019":"Very comfortable","1020":"Shoe seems soft, comfortable, durable, yet on the wide and also the short side. I wear an 8 1\/2 tennis shoe and a 9 otherwise. The 7-8 and 1\/2  (women) was a bit short in length on me. I will probably pick another color since the Olive Green is NOT olive green at all, but really is brown.","1021":"Love these shoes","1022":"I've only had these for a week.  I wear them after getting out of the shower while getting dressed.  They are very comfortable and provide the cloud like comfort that I need.  If they remain comfortable, they were a great buy.","1023":"2","1024":"I washed and dried these shoes the first day they arrived and have been wearing them ever since, around home and out and about.  They answer a want and need. Wish more design variations like this were available.  Hear that, Universe?","1025":"I've been wanting to get a pair of these slippers for a while and finally decided to try them out. So comfy!I saw different reviews about the size difference, so I wasn't sure what size to get.I have wide feet, but that wasn't an issue. I am a true 9.5 so I ordered the 9.5\/10. My heel and toes were over the shoe. I ordered the 10.5\/11 and the fit was perfect. I could've even gone another size up and it probably would've been ok as well.","1026":"Bought these for my sister. Delivery was prompt and color and fit were as expected. She loved them.","1027":"Fit as expected, I usually wear 9 - 9 1\/2 and I ordered 9-10 I they are perfect. I wii buy one for my husband too so he can wear at home and rest his feet","1028":"I suffer from plantar fasciitis and heel spurs and Achilles insertion tendinitis \u2014 these shoes make me feel like I\u2019m waking on soft marshmallows. Pain free walking. Thank you.","1029":"After I spent $50 on a pair of oofoos I did not like them at all. So I tried these slippers and simply they are the best. Just goes to show you that price doesn't make it better","1030":"I am usually a size 6.5 so I got the 6-7. They fit at first but when I wore them outside they might have shrunk in the sun ? I would recommend buying a size larger than what you are.","1031":"Worn for weeks now and no signs of wear and tear, although I do mainly wear them indoors. Insanely comfy and easy to clean. Color and size are as advertised. Highly recommend.","1032":"As someone who has problems with my feet & legs, these are a godsend. I was worried at first at how flat they are but they're wonderful.I heard so many times that these are like \"walking on a cloud\" & it is true. Super comfortable. The only thing that can get annoying is that small rocks can get stuck in the grooves of the shoe on the bottom side, but they pop right out.I highly recommend these & will be back to get more colors.","1033":"If you have wide feet like me order a size up. Love them but gave them to my son to grow into.","1034":"Like these but they run to small","1035":"Honestly they are kind of ugly but they are so comfortable! I always wear them around the house and now all my family members want a pair too.","1036":"I really like the comfort and the support from these slipper. Unfortunately thry shrank to third of its size when I left them outside in the sun for a few hrs. Pretty useless at this point. Only my toes go in the shoe! Pitty & very strange!","1037":"It fits to loose","1038":"Wore these during a cross country road trip. Comfortable and durable. I have a pair of fila sliders that are pretty thick but these felt much better. I\u2019ve took long walks in them as well. Great fit and feel. I was concerned whether they would be cheap but they don\u2019t.","1039":"The best sandels for comfort. They feel so good on your feet, definitely worth the money!","1040":"These slippers are what I expected and MORE!!!  It does feel like walking on a cloud!  I wish all the colors came in bigger sizes because I think I would buy them all!  They are sooooo comfortable and easy.  This is worth every single penny!  Now, excuse me as I go order more pairs.","1041":"Ok so I was expecting a not so good product,  but when I slide my feet into them they are so so so comfortable. I will be ordering about three more pair. Only thing please do not wear wet or if you oil your feet you will fall and hurt yourself so be careful and mindful other than that I am in love with them. Please restock the cheetah\/ leopard pair back in all sizes. You won't be disappointed","1042":"Pros: first non sneaker that feels acceptable for my plantar plate injury and accompanying metatarsal pain. Super cushioned. Nice and wide for my bunion.Cons: no real arch support, so I wear a arch support sleeve","1043":"While they definitely feel rubbery on my feet, they are by far one of the comfiest pairs of sandals\/house shoes I have ever owned! My feet feel supported, and even without a back strap I don't feel like they are going to fall off, and despite the rubbery feel and being a warm-bodied person, my feet have never been sweaty! Highly recommend if you are looking for a house shoe, a casual sandal, or just want some extra support\/comfy shoes.","1044":"Super cute and fit amazing! I mean my foot slides out a tinnnyyy bit sometimes but they are EXACTLY what I was looking for","1045":"This dark pink is what the \u201cice pink\u201d looks like in real life. SO disappointed!","1046":"Too wide and larger than my first pair","1047":"I like everything but the sz runs large.","1048":"I wear a 7.5-8 and some 8.5. These are very big for a 8. I\u2019m really not please how these are sized.If you like big shoes to drag these shoes would be for you. I don\u2019t!","1049":"They are super comfortable and great for the beach or as a slipper in house.","1050":"I wear a size 7.5 bought the size 7-8. Was way too big.","1051":"These are literally the most comfortable slides I have ever worn. I\u2019ve already purchased more.","1052":"I got a size 8 and I'm normally an 8.5. They fit perfectly for me and super comfy. They did take a few wears to break them in. They were rubbing my little toe but just needed some wear and they're all I want to put on now.","1053":"I wear it daily.  It is very cushiony or bouncy. After nearly a year, it is still comfortable, but it lost some of its bounciness after a year of daily use. Maybe it is time to buy a new one perhaps. As a slipper-wearer my whole life I judge that this is perhaps the best pair of slippers I've owned.","1054":"Incredibly cushioned and comfortable, and surprisingly buoyant!","1055":"I loooove the cushioning and light weight. I am on my legs around more than 13 or 14 hours daily and I miss them at my job. I am not allowed to use uncovering toes shoes \ud83d\ude29","1056":"These are so soft. I wear them around the house and after I get out of the shower.If your feet are wet, you need to be careful wearing ANY slide. They\u2019re called \u201cslides\u201d for a reason \ud83d\ude05 anyway, I love these for stepping outside but mostly indoors. I wear them everyday and they\u2019re holding up super well.I wear a size 8 normally, 8.5 in sandals\/slides and I purchased an 8-9. I kinda want another pair for strictly outdoor use","1057":"Loved, loved these.","1058":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0They fit to a T, and so damn comfortable!","1059":"Ran a tad small but also not soft and comfortable at all. I returned them. Try the Joomra\u2019s instead. Night and day.","1060":"I was so excited to order these but quite disappointed when they arrived. Yes, they are soft, but fit like wearing boats on my feet.  I returned them and am sticking with Crocs.","1061":"Imagine yourself walking on a bed of marshmallows and you well understand the feeling you get when you walk in these slides. They are that amazing. I have back issues with nerve pain going into my foot. These slides help in reducing my pain and help me to function on a daily basis. I put these slides among my most comfortable shoes that don\u2019t provoke any more pain for me. Im very pleased. I have worn them around the house every day since I got them and I see no, if any wear and tear. I highly recommend them. I\u2019m considering another pair in navy blue. I wish they could design a stylish shoe with this type of sole, I\u2019d buy one in each of the main colors!","1062":"This maybe my new addiction. I don\u2019t want to ever take them off. That\u2019s how comfortable these are. Perfect for running errands, doing chores around the house.","1063":"Fits perfectly & love the thick soles","1064":"Way too wide,more for a man.loved the coloe","1065":"They look rather large but having a size 11 foot guess that is to be expected. They are though very comfortable, likening to walking on pillows or clouds.  Boyfriend wants a pair in black. Definitely recommend.","1066":"Very supportive and comfortable!! Love them.","1067":"I am a 6 ft man 275 lbs athletic and wanted to buy them for their thickness.. When I first put them on I was having a hard time balancing myself and didn't like them. I pushed through on not giving up on them that easy and found out I needed to break them in. They feel custom made for me only after 3 days and couldn't be more comfortable...problem is I'm wearing them everywhere I go and and seriously not missing my other shoes etc. Lol! I'm going to order  several more pairs as one never knows if the vendor is going to discontinue them...Remember to give everything more than 1 try before moving on and posting negative reviews before giving it your best...Happy holidays and enjoy your new favorite everything shoe","1068":"I bought these for my 92 year old mother who is still living in her home alone. They are slightly big for her usual size 8 but she really likes them for around the house","1069":"Perfect for around the house, when on your feet baking, cooking, only had for couple days, don\u2019t know durability, will check back later, happy with my purchase so far","1070":"Great product. I would recommend ordering 1\/2 size bigger because mine feel a little tight and I have skinny feet","1071":"OMG.....super cute and super comfortable. I hate touching my hardwood floors with my barefeet...and now I don't have to. I wasn't going for style but these are not only comfortable...it is cute. The pink matches with my pajamas","1072":"Not the cutest sandals but WOW are they comfy! So much cushion. I am 34 weeks pregnant and live in these shoes at home. I am tempted to buy another pair. One for house slippers and one to wear outside. I promise you I will live in these sandals all spring and summer. I have flat feet so being on my feet in the house for hours on end leaves my back hurting. I do not have this problem with these sandals. I ordered the 9-10 and wear a size 9. They are a little large but my foot does NOT slide around. I will be ordering the same size again soon.","1073":"Comfortable shoe, but im a size 7.5 I ordered the 7.5-8.5 and the shoe is slightly too small. Otherwise nice shoe","1074":"Scetchers is 1000% better, but triple the $$$. Good for water, but slippery. No stitching to wear out. Just not soft as they say, not at all.6 out of 10, for me.","1075":"I have trouble with pain in my feet. These are some of the best comfort I have experienced in a while. Love that I can wear them in the yard, clean them off and wear them inside or out shopping. Great comfortable shoes.","1076":"I got these to use while standing at work. I have two different stations for a standing desk and didn't want to buy two anti-stress standing mats. These shoes are the perfect alternative. They're just as soft and squishy as a mat, but they're light and portable so I can take them anywhere.Size-wise, I bought a size that should have been slightly too big, but they're just right for length, which means buy a size up to be safe. The upper is very generous, and too wide for my narrow feet, but as I said, I don't use them for walking around so, for my purposes, these are just fine. I am loving them!","1077":"Unexpected benefit. I have a history of ankle surgery. Every morning I carry downstairs two 20 pound pug dogs (separately!!) and the first morning wearing these sandals I discovered that they alleviated the pain I have in my ankles!","1078":"I wear 7.5 and the size is definitely off. Haha\u2026they are super comfortable though. Will be returning and hopefully getting a more accurate size.","1079":"It\u2019s sooo amazing and comfy like you\u2019re walking on pillows how soft it is","1080":"I love these shoes! They are so comfy. I have plantar fasciitis and these are the only shoes I can wear when I have a flare up.Water proof. Easy to clean.","1081":"I purchased these slippers to wear in the hard, tile shower, but found they\u2019re so comfy!!!!!  I\u2019ve worn them all day, everywhere now, for2 days to make sure they really are as pillow soft as they feel on my feel.  Incredible support for pressure points and my high arches.  The slippers seem to be moulding to my footprint in each shoe.When I first put them on, it was instant, and I mean, straight signal from feet to the brain, Seriously comfortable.  They did feel a bit \u201coff\u201d for my foot as if they were almost higher on the outside of the foot cradle.  It\u2019s not enough for me to return them b\/c no way could the comfort level and cushioning sensation be improved.  I\u2019m hoping the more I wear them, the more the shoe will adjust to my feet inside.  Everything I hoped, and will be buying more!","1082":"Fit better than the well known brand you see everyone using. more comfortable and color options","1083":"Comfort and also how light they are .  She has a bunion and it is difficult to find a slipper that fits . These are perfect , so comfortable.  We will be purchasing another pair .","1084":"Comfortable and exactly as described. Good indoor and out.","1085":"These are not comfortable and are not soft. They were a disappointment all around.","1086":"Great for around the house for my husband.  Were a little wide for his slim foot","1087":"So comfy. Fits a size 7\/12-8. A size 8\/12 foot wouldn\u2019t fit. I\u2019m a true 8 and I barely fit so that\u2019s the only problem. So I would definitely size up if your a true 8 1\/2.","1088":"These shoes are amazingly comfortable and I own multiple pairs of them. They do run a little big so order a size down.","1089":"Sizes run big. Definitely order at least a size smaller than normal.","1090":"As someone who suffers from heel spurs, I can honestly say that these have made walking first this in the morning a much more pleasant experience. Highly recommend.","1091":"I have been looking for a soft pair of \"slippers\" for a long time. I suffer from Plantar Fasciitis and bone spurs on my heels. I was told I could no longer go bare foot. These are by far the best slippers\/slides I have found! They are very comfortable to wear all day if you can. I would recommend that you get a size larger. I wear a size 10 and I ordered a 10.5-11 women's and they fit perfectly! I highly recommend these slides!","1092":"A mi hijo le encantaron \u00e9l es talla 12 y le quedaron perfectas, son muy c\u00f3modas y amortiguan perfectamente al caminar, s\u00faper recomendables.","1093":"The slides are the most comfortable shoe I have ever put on my foot. It literally feels like you are walking on clouds and if you are short like me, make you look an extra inch taller. The biggest con is that these shoes are hideous. I could care less but if you are looking for a cute slide these are not for you. If you want comfort, buy one in every color.","1094":"These shoes are so comfy! Spongy! I ordered from a different seller because they were a lot less expensive. They were hard and hurt my feet. Amazon quickly refunded my purchase and I ordered these. Perfect house slippers, but can be worn outside. I will eventually get other colors. I now have yellow!","1095":"i had saw the reviews for this slipper, and i wasn\u2019t expecting it to be THIS SQUISHY!! it feels like im walking on a cloud. but if you are used to a stiff slipper, be careful as these are very squishy. so very happy!","1096":"Ordered an additional color and the same size ordered was different depending on which color was ordered. Had to return and try again.","1097":"I love the light pink color and the softness of the material. It\u2019s a soft rubber material, if that makes sense. It is too soft and also \u201cnon-slip\u201d that whenever I walk, it gets stuck and bends in the front causing me to trip quite a lot.","1098":"I really like the sandal but I have a pretty wide foot and it was too tight.","1099":"I like the Cloud Sliders. They are very comfortable","1100":"Using these as house slippers or when I go out in the yard.  I've had no problems with the slipping or catching.  Very comfortable and does seem to relieve my back pain a little.  Very happy with them.","1101":"I wear an 8\/8.5 in women shoes.  These size 7.5\/8 were WAY to small; like maybe a size 7. Definitely size up.  Super comfy so I will be trying the bigger size.","1102":"Comfortable","1103":"These feel like clouds on my feet! I love them!","1104":"My son got for college as shower shoes but is wearing them all the time because he says they are so comfortable!  Holding up great so far!","1105":"Very soft and comfortable, it feels like you are walking on clouds, not to mention that it reduces the impact on the ground. I highly recommend !!!","1106":"The first time I put these on I thought how comfortable could a pair of shoes be then I wore them a few more times and I found I\u2019d misstep and trip.  sometimes they would be so comfortable but walking still feel a bit gaudy.  I thought about a smaller size the only problem is the cover over the top fits perfect and probably wouldn\u2019t on a smaller size","1107":"Relief from wearing shoes\u2026 very comfortable and spongy!","1108":"","1109":"I have balance issues and these don\u2019t work well with that. They are wonderful other than that.","1110":"Much bigger than sized, fell off my feet. Comfortable though and cushy. Had to return.","1111":"Big shoe. Though the cushion of the shoe is nice, its a bit wide & clumsy. I suggest ordering one size smaller.","1112":"These are cute but run a little small half size too small","1113":"These are what I expected and wanted. Great for when I\u2019m at the pool or chilin around the house. I love them","1114":"Love the softness","1115":"Yes it\u2019s","1116":"Just as described. I got the 7.5-8.5 and typically wear a size 8. Would recommend!","1117":"I love them! Super soft, comfortable and cute!! Definitely purchasing more colors \ud83d\ude0d","1118":"They are like walking on pillows!  So comfortable and highly recommend!","1119":"Great color, extremely comfortable.  I bought them for my child for their birthday.  They initially were not interested, but as usual Mom hit on another fabulously comfortable pair of shoes that they won't take off.  They want a pair for their partner.  I already have a pair and find them very comfortable, but mine are too big.","1120":"Not impressed","1121":"They are great. A bit short","1122":"I like the color and it is comfortable. However, it's so big! The length fit nicely but there was so much space at the top of my feet, it was not touching the slides. When I walk it would slip right off. And the overall cushion around the perimeter of the slides just makes your feet look extra big. I'm a 6 and it made my feet look like a size 8. Nothing wrong with a size 8! Just saying it made my feet look bigger than it is... not sure about you, but I did not like that.","1123":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0If you have narrow foot it will big for you. But that\u2019s what I looked for.","1124":"They are Awesome","1125":"I like it very much.  But I wish it was little  bet cheaper. I would like to have more of different  colors  but, its up there on the cost..","1126":"They are the most comfy slides ever","1127":"Very soft and easy to clean! The color was great too even though it wasn\u2019t my first choice. The only surprise was it ran small I\u2019m going to order up on my next pair.","1128":"","1129":"I need to wear it with my socks. Without socks, I get shoe sore on my instep and side of foot. The surface of material has some textures and the inside is not smooth.It is soft, but I feel a little unstable while walking.","1130":"Very comfortable! I\u2019m usually a size 8 so I ordered 7.5-8.5 and they are very big, I would size down if I were to reorder!","1131":"I did send this product back as it was not what I was looking for and my refund was given promply.","1132":"I bought these because most slides and flips are not comfortable for me because I have foot pain. I can walk in these indoors for hours without pain. I use them for short distances outside also. Once I knew they were so comfortable I bought more in different colors.","1133":"These slippers are comfortable but not durable. They ripped after one day","1134":"True size is too large. I reordered a smaller size. I hope they fit.","1135":"Everything to like about this shoe. Comfortable, soft.","1136":"\ud83d\udc4d","1137":"These are good if you\u2019re not walking for more than 5 minutes at a time, otherwise you\u2019ll get blisters.","1138":"Love my new slippers soft and comfortable so comfortable that my husband want to pair","1139":"I have severe back problems where it hurts to walk.  These slippers absorb any impact and make it much easier to get around.  I've even worn them shopping.","1140":"I received 2 different sizes. I got that is a size 39-40 and one shoe that\u2019s 40-41. Shoes are very comfortable, but having different sizes makes it difficult to really enjoy. However, if I had both shoes in the same size they are both wearable\u2026if your debating going up or down, but the larger ones are just slightly better. Unfortunately I wore them outside before I noticed they were different sizes.","1141":"These marshmallow soft slides are just what I need for long hours standing in the kitchen. My feet do not hurt anymore after wearing these. They are springy and light.","1142":"They are very comfortable slippers.  I would recommend if you looking for something soft and comfortable to wear after a long day of work.","1143":"Love them !!!","1144":"These would have been great but the fit was awkward at best. One shoe was to big and rubbed on side of foot. The other shoe was to snug. Did not feel safe walking in these shoes. Had to return them as they appeared to be defective.","1145":"Purchased to wear in hospital during labor and delivery. Did not disappoint. Felt like walking on clouds! Why I did not purchase these earlier in my pregnancy is beyond me. Husband is also wanting a pair for the hospital!","1146":"Wow the minute I sipped these one , my feet sighed in relief. I suffer from plantar fasciitis and these are great. Will most likely purchase in more colors. And they are the perfect fit as I have wide feet with high arches.","1147":"I wore another brand last summer and they were comfortable\u2026I can\u2019t find them around where I am at so I tried theses out.  And exactly as described","1148":"These shoes are super comfortable!!","1149":"These are the most comfortable shoes I\u2019ve ever tried on but I would suggest to size down","1150":"Love the color. Really  comfy.","1151":"Can't wait to put these on when I get home, like walking on marshmallows with support. May even wear them to the grocery store someday!","1152":"\u2026and they are fantastic. It\u2019s like having a mobile fatigue mat. I have a fussy knee and I cook a lot, and these shoes have cut my discomfort from being on my feet for hours down to almost zero.","1153":"These cloud shoes are so comfortable!  If you have planters fasciitis, these are perfect slip on for you.","1154":"Buy them, you won\u2019t regret it!","1155":"I ordered the pink in 9-10 and they fit nice I usually ware a 9. I ordered the tan in 9-10 and they are too big I can\u2019t ware them!","1156":"I got two gray and black ones they are super comfy have one for inside the house and another one for out side","1157":"Not right size for men in xlg. More firm than I expected. Gave to a friend who loved them.","1158":"I liked the comfort as I walk around and stand. I would recommend buying this product.","1159":"Spongy","1160":"Fits very well. A bit awkward during the first two wears, but feels natural over time.","1161":"Comfortable but not wide enough.","1162":"Because the strap is not adjustable, unless it fits your foot perfectly it'll move around as you walk.  When I add socks the fit is better but i don't want to wear socks with slip ons in the summer.","1163":"Very fast shipment and the product is as described on Amazon. Very comfortable and my feet do not slip around while wearing them. The sizing is correct and the price is affordable.","1164":"Love them even though they look like prison shower slippers","1165":"Est\u00e1 s\u00faper comidas a mi ayudan mucho con mi s pies nesesitan zapatos especiales y an sido d mucha ayuda","1166":"A good indicator of comfort level is\u2026.I\u2019ve taken to three friends homes so they could experience how great these Slides feel. And they agree, like standing on a cloud!","1167":"Feels like rubber. Very hot. Not really soft. Would not buy again.","1168":"Probably it just me, but runs a little small and just hard keeping sandals on.","1169":"I have been so excited to receive these shoes, and the comfort was not a disappointment! Amazing comfort. So, so flexible and comfy to walk in. However, the presentation was a bit poor. I received my item with lines through the shoes and obvious little flaws. No biggie, I know I\u2019ll wear them often and cause a bit of wear & tear, but was a bit disappointed to receive them like that. Still amazing comfort!! Definitely recommend.","1170":"Will order another pair.","1171":"Bought these to wear around the house and to help with ongoing pain\/swelling in my feet. These are so comfy and meet all my expectations!","1172":"Was ok... just no support at all. Of you have high arches dont do. Very comfortable but didn't support my feet.","1173":"I have all hard floors in my house and my feet have been hurting especially while doing all the housework. These slides changed all that! They are so comfy, give me all the support and I can get everything done in my house without having my feet feel so sore by the end of the day! These are amazing! Love love love \ud83d\udc95","1174":"Nice for inside shoes, very comfy","1175":"I bought this shoe after seeing it on YouTube. I always look for comfortable shoes. I do a lot of walking so comfort is very important. I have worn these shoes a lot and they still feel like the first time I put my foot in it","1176":"I was super excited for these to arrive but when I opened them up they were shrunken and curled up so small that I couldnt flatten them or even squish my foot into them at all. I ordered my right size but these looked like two sizes too small. I tried to use a blow dryer like the other reviews stated but there was no fixing these. I want to order another pair because the material feels like it would be really comfortable but I'm worried I will get another pair like that.","1177":"Friggin love these things.First things I put on after a long day of standing on my feet.10\/10 highly recommend.Would love if they came out with new ones that had a little better arch support? But I\u2019d still buy them again even if they never change. Bought my gf a pair like a month after I got mine \ud83e\udd23","1178":"They just look huge even though they fit \u2026 wearing them only around the house","1179":"They are a bit bo bo looking on your bare feet (at first I thought they were too big, but they weren't), but other than that, I love them!  And now that I've been wearing them constantly around the house for several weeks, I can attest to their comfort.  I am rather flat footed, so I appreciate that there is no irritating over arch support.","1180":"I have had 3 foot surgeries so I can\u2019t wear just any shoes or sandals, I\u2019m sure they would have been comfy but way too wide to wear, I do have a narrow foot","1181":"I want one In every color","1182":"Nice support and easy to wear","1183":"I ordered  the pale pink in the women's size 6\/7 fit perfect as I\u2019m at 6 and a half.Love the feel, haven\u2019t taken them off!So soft and comfy I even wear them out and about to the grocery store etc! They also look fabulous with leggings or jeans!","1184":"Love the fit & the softness of this slide. I wear them daily!","1185":"I brought this for my mom and she loves them.","1186":"These slides are the comfiest and cutest shoes that I currently own. I get compliments on them all the time!","1187":"It\u2019s as expected fit well","1188":"I love","1189":"They are super comfortable and love to use them around the house to go the pool. My new faves!","1190":"Too wide","1191":"Not very comfortable","1192":"These look and feel awesome","1193":"I tend to sweat in slippers, especially fleece. These slippers are super comfy and no sweaty feet! My only issue is they are not easily slip on and off. I have to kick them off my feet to get in and out. The color is bright and gives lots of support.","1194":"I ordered these in brown because I had a pair of black ones that offered great support and were very comfortable. I initially bought the black ones as pool shoes for my cruise. I think I wore the 90% of the time. I even wore them to dinner a few times.Fast forward to ordering them in brown. They must\u2019ve been manufactured in different places. They are not they don\u2019t feel the same at all. The only good thing is that they are soft. Otherwise, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be ordering any other colors as I had planned.","1195":"These are the best. I saw them on the NBC morning show. Ordered within 5 minutes","1196":"Comfort on the feet","1197":"Inexpensive shower shoes, super comfy. I wear them around the house instead of slippers. They are great!!","1198":"Got these cause my knees hurt when I wore my UA sliders on my hardwoods. Knee pain gone. 'Nuff said","1199":"They don\u2019t have the best look, but this sandals are confortable, I feel like in the air every time I wear them","1200":"My hips hurts after wearing them","1201":"These were wide on the sides of my feet and when I wore them to the park they rubbed sores on the top of my feet.  The soles of them are very comfortable but the sizing is not good for the shape of me feet.","1202":"Comfort","1203":"These slides fit as expected and they are comfortable. I purchased 3 pair. Highly recommend these slides","1204":"this item is great","1205":"Soft and comfy like a cloud.  Good for around the pool.","1206":"i\u2019ve had these shoes for almost a year and since wearing them by the pool or lake in the summer, the sun has continued to shrink them by the day and i\u2019m no longer able to fit in them","1207":"Love these comfy house slippers. I almost forget I have them on.","1208":"Super comfy and I love wearing them around the house and to garden.","1209":"This is the 4th pair I\u2019ve bought from various websites but these are hands down the best. They\u2019re cute and very comfortable.","1210":"I could wear these all day rain or shineLove them and","1211":"These slides are absolutely squishy. I like the way there is a little bit of the rebound effect as I walk. There is no substitution for the cloud slides.","1212":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0I've ordered two other brands of these cloud slides on Amazon, but these have been the best ones! I was looking for something to wear after my runs to help with recovery\/ a less expensive version of Oofos. These are squishy, but not so much that you lose stability. They feel like they're the same level of squish as Oofos. They fit perfectly. I wear anywhere from 10-11 depending on brand\/ type of shoe (Teva's vs Crocs vs running shoes) & these are exactly the right length. Thinking about getting more colors!","1213":"I already want a second pair! Very comfortable even on wide feet! I bought the pink, they seem to run large but not too large.","1214":"I bought these because a friend told me \"had to\" and they are awesome! I am an oofos lover, and I do think they provide a bit more support, but these cloud slippers are VERY comfy. I found them to run a little bit big. I'm a 7.5 in shoes.","1215":"Wanted to try them","1216":"Could not be more comfortable. Pro tip: wear socks","1217":"When I put it on it was a bit too big in the size asked for.","1218":"I originally bought them to wear in the shower to keep my feet out of any standing water, but they fill up with water themselves, so no good for that. They are comfortable for wearing around the house, and my feet have hurt less since I started doing so instead of not wearing any shoes.They are rather wide, but maybe the hair dryer trick will help with the fit.","1219":"So comfy!","1220":"I wear these strictly inside as an indoor slipper. So comfy","1221":"Great product, comfy on your feet. Does run wide.","1222":"Amazing support, so soft, and I think they are actually cute!I can\u2019t say enough wonderful things about this product! I love these shoes!","1223":"I got these for my wife. She is a size 7 and so it fits pretty snug. If you want a bit more room go a size up. Overall pretty comfy. Wish they had exact size not the in between.","1224":"Great comfort and style, I wear them with everything dresses, Bermuda shorts, skirts and I plan on wearing them to the pool.","1225":"Not enough support for me.  Will be returning shoes.","1226":"Shower shoes for college student.","1227":"They feel like boats ! A bit too thick for meThe heel part is a bit wonkyReal strange","1228":"Most comfy shoe. Love these  everyone needs at least one pair","1229":"DO YOURSELF A SOLID AND BUY A PAIR OF THESE RN. HECK\u2026 BUY TWO. THESE SLIDES ARE GOD TIER. SO HECKIN\u2019 COMFY. MY FEET HAVE NOT TOUCHED THE FLOOR OF MY APARTMENT SINCE THESE BAD BOYS ARRIVED. 10\/10","1230":"Super comfortable highly recommend","1231":"Super comfy. Feels like you walking on cushion .","1232":"Love the bright pink","1233":"I have arthritis and plantar fasciiitis in both feet, and am unable to stand easily\/walk upon waking, or when I get home from working on hard floors all day. I wear these from the moment I get home until bed, and slip into them first thing in the morning, so that I can walk without pain. I think they are super ugly, but I truly don't care, since my pain disappears as soon as I put them on. The only issue is that my teenage daughter keeps stealing them, so I'm back here to buy her a pair! I 200% recommend these squishy slides for anyone with fascia pain or foot arthritis.","1234":"Love this so much! My family bought some too. We all love them!!","1235":"Nothing to dislike. So comfortable so worth every penny.","1236":"These are the most comfy house shoes!  Highly Recommend, especially if you are on your feet all day.  You will be anxious to put these on when you get home!","1237":"These are so comfortable. Theyre so light weight and I haven\u2019t taken them off since I got them 6 hours ago :))","1238":"I'm a size 11 and these are true to fit. Very comfortable takes the pressure off of your joints, ankles, knees and hips.","1239":"ok","1240":"Was a gift.  My friend was elated.  She wore all weekend and could not compliment enough!","1241":"Overall there are super comfy , only thing is for unisex small a lil big on me but wearable :)","1242":"I\u2019m an 8.5 \/9 and it was too big for me so my hubby is wearing them. I\u2019ll size down for my next purchase.","1243":"Soooo comfy! I use them as my house slippers since I don\u2019t wear outside shoes inside. Like walking on a cloud!","1244":"The strap rubs top of my foot.","1245":"Great for around the pool but wouldn\u2019t wear them out","1246":"Nice idea and very spongy sole but top strap is not adjustable and very large.  Can't recommend unless you have a big foot.  Sasquatch endorsed!","1247":"They are so comfortable and stylish! Wifey approved","1248":"I\u2019m sorry but they are ugly. To squishy too. I feel like I am walking on a mattress and very unstable. I\u2019m returning them.","1249":"They're not as soft as I was hoping for but honestly what killed it for me was the fact that it's straight rubber on the top band and it leaves blisters because it's super long and the tops of my feet\/arch area rub the band when walking.","1250":"Finally something I can wear and be pain free","1251":"Love!","1252":"I usually wear a 10.5 and ordered the women 10-11 and they fit perfect!! I love how comfy and cute they are. Definitely will purchase more colors!","1253":"Very comfy but way too big unfortunately I missed the return window. I wear a 9-9.5 usually and 7-8 was still 1 inch too big. Runs very big I prob should of ordered 6-7 if that was a size which is crazy.","1254":"Comfortable","1255":"The media could not be loaded.","1256":"it\u2019s light however it\u2019s loose the length is great it\u2019s just ok and makes noise when when you walk","1257":"I love how my feet feel when I slip into these, after being on my feet all day.  I just wish I had them sooner!!","1258":"The Best for tired feet. Love them for sooo many reasons.","1259":"I was looking for a comfortable and soft flip flop and this flip flop met the requirements","1260":"Supper soft as advertised.  Not designed for support but allow for comfortable walking or standing on hard surfaces. They are designed for wide feet. My feet are too narrow. So the fit wad not great. I could not be bothered to return them so I gave them away.","1261":"Fit good.. comfortable.. sized properly. I got a large my foot is a 9","1262":"Loved these slides the first 4-6 weeks i\u2019ve had them. I noticed them getting tighter and now after about 3 months my foot won\u2019t fit in them. They went from a men\u2019s size 9-10 to probably a 7-8. Not sure if heat caused it, I live in AZ and wear them outside near my pool and leave them on pool deck in the sun. Whatever the cause, beware of major shrinkage! Super comfy when they fit though, loved em for a short time.","1263":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0Truly I have constant leg and foot pain since breaking my leg and ankle, and these provide more relief than I can explain. Beauty in relief. Buy these.","1264":"perfect","1265":"Lovely type of indoor shoes.  Although, you could use them as an outdoor shoes.","1266":"Best purchase. Feels like i am walking on clouds. I totally recommend.","1267":"These are seriously the most comfortable shoes ever, got them in the tan color and they are so cute and so comfy! Will be wearing these everywhere and definitely getting them on other colors!","1268":"Not a true size. Length  wise.","1269":"These are my favorites. I don\u2019t care if they don\u2019t match what I\u2019m wearing, I still wear it. They are the most comfortable slides ever. I have back problems and these definitely make walking around easier","1270":"Not my favorite purchase. Slightly larger than I would like and hard to keep balanced on the soft sole.","1271":"Big and clunky, they kept falling off of my feet.","1272":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0Love them so much that I\u2019ll probably wear them every day \ud83d\ude0d","1273":"I brought them for hopefully their comfort! They are too wide for my feet!","1274":"It is difficult to get a perfect fit, but they are so comfy! I wear them everywhere!","1275":"I am a size 10.5-11 mens shoe. I purchased the 10.5 size, but my heels were hanging off the end of it. So I returned them and got the next size up, but they were still just barely fitting my foot in the shoe. I ended up returning both of them. My wife loves hers, though - she has two pairs and they fit her perfectly. Maybe it's just a men's thing?","1276":"They are the best house shoe I have ever put on my feet. Support, comfort, and softness in every way.","1277":"These are ok and were very comfortable the first couple hours.  After long periods of wearing they started rubbing under my big toe. Could be just getting used to them.","1278":"Great support.","1279":"The most comfortable shoes I own!","1280":"Grandkids say very comfortable and easy to slip into after soccer games.","1281":"These are so comfy!  I wore them every day on a recent beach trip.  I knew they would be comfortable, but far surpassed my expectations!!!","1282":"Very comfortable I love wearing these when I get off of work since I\u2019m on my feet all day they help the soreness go away","1283":"Fantastic product. Highly recommended","1284":"They are spot on dupes and are comfortable. Fit exactly as expected. If your at larger 8 1\/2 size up they fit me spot on. So cute and I wear them everywhere. Would buy again.","1285":"Too big, strap on shoe is extra big, foot slides through..","1286":"Nice n comfy","1287":"Put these on when I get home every day!  They are soft, but supportive at the same time. I only gave 4 stars on support because there is no arch support on these slides. If you need arch support, these are not the ones to get.","1288":"If you get these only wear them inside or use as shower slides. Would not recommend because the slides will shrink by 1-2 sizes when left in the heat or sun. Good look and good comfort at first, but they really missed the mark with the integrity of the product. Go to a reputable brand don\u2019t waste your money here.","1289":"I really like these shoes because they are very comfortable!!!\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd","1290":"I like the shoe for the softness and comfort","1291":"My sister bought me a pair of these shoes in early 2022 and I was in love! I ordered a pair for my husband in may and they were not nearly as squishy or comfortable as mine. I thought it was a fluke so I returned and ordered another pair\u2026same issue. They\u2019re not terrible unless you know what you\u2019re missing. I can tell they\u2019ve started making them with a cheaper material so just beware","1292":"I was really looking forward to getting these shoes. I needed some comfy shoes to wear around the house as I have feet problems. These are so thick & like clown shoes. They fit but I can\u2019t even describe how it feels to walk in them. They are wide  I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll trip and break something.  I wear a 6 1\/2 or 7 and bought the 6-7. Someone described the comfort like Oofos. No! Not even comparable. There is no support. Just a little squish when you walk. I will be returning but I really did try to like them.","1293":"I was looking for a really good pair of house slippers for the warmer months as my old pair were fuzzy for winter. I don't enjoy walking on my floors bare foot, so, I did some research and found these. I was skeptical at first, but, after putting them on, I was extremely impressed.","1294":"Love the shoe the first one I ordered two small had to re-order different brand larger size for my husband","1295":"This are very soft and comfy. However they fit smaller, I normally wear size 7.5 but the size 8 aren't long enough.","1296":"The media could not be loaded.","1297":"these are so comfy! i am so glad i decided to buy them","1298":"Very comfortable! I would recommend to anyone looking for a slide that is durable and comfortable","1299":"These are super comfy, however beyond bulky on your feet. I wear a 7 they are true to size definitely do not want to wear these out besides at home.","1300":"After I use the blow dryer to make them a  bit more tighter they were perfect","1301":"Super comfortable and they have become my favorite house shoe, lol.  I have purchased three pairs, two for out of the house and one for indoors only.  I love them, can't recommend enough!","1302":"Like I said before, these are extremely comfy, they run just a little bigger... like I bought a size 6, I think a 5 & half or a 5 would have fit like a glove.","1303":"These shoes are super supportive and comfortable.  No breaking them in...fit is great.","1304":"The happy wife reports these are super comfy and recommended.","1305":"These slides help so much with my pregnancy waddle. My back and hips doesn\u2019t hurt at all anymore. As I began my third trimester, it pained me to walk, with these shoes it feel like I\u2019m walking on pillows. They are cute too!!! I purchased my second pair the next day after wearing them for the first time.","1306":"LOVE these shoes!","1307":"Omg! These are the best slippers ever! So soft and comfortable! I will order again!","1308":"Color, size, comfort","1309":"The tops of the shoes are loose on my feet.  I have to be careful to be sure my feet don\u2019t slide out of the shoes.","1310":"I loved the support and red shoe color; however these shoes are unwearable outside of my home due to a white line crease on the top right shoe.  I was extremely disappointed because I was planning on wearing them on errands, etc","1311":"Worth every penny! True to size, comfortable, durable, and cute. My new favorite slides!","1312":"I didn\u2019t like this product because the shoes were spongy and no arch support Also they are to big","1313":"Can't get used to the artificial materials, make my feet sweat.","1314":"I was very surprised on how comfortable these slides are. I walk all day so when I get home, these are the best to wear after work.","1315":"Every day sandals, going on the boat","1316":"Most likely returning these. My expectations weren't very high to begin with- they just looked so comfortable and squishy, and I wanted something to slip on easily and wear around the house when my feet are hurting. I've been flooded with ads for similar sandals and wanted to give them a try.I ordered 1 pair in black and 1 pair in pink in the 7.5-8.5. I am normally always a size 8 so I figured this would be safe. But the black pair is noticeably smaller than the pink for some reason. I like the black better, but have to return them because my heels actually hang off the back edge. And I don't want to re-order them because the sizing is obviously not consistent. The pink fit better but still not sure if I want to keep them. They are noticeably scuffed from packaging\/shipping (these sandals did not come in a box and were packaged so tightly squished\/ folded together that they indented each other.) And they have these noticeable scrappy seams along some edges. (not so rough looking on the black pair)The texture of the material has kind of a slippery\/slimy feel that felt strange at first, but overall they are comfortable enough for basic wear around the house. Might just return and try ordering another black pair from a different company.","1317":"I bought these for a beach trip and I absolutely loved them. Light, comfy, supportive, easy to clean. I wore them every day and they never hurt my feet. Buying them in other colors now as well!","1318":"Softer than I expected and definitely like waking on a cloud my achy feet love them.","1319":"The amount of fluffiness makes my heels sink down further than the rest of my foot, putting my foot in a weird, uncomfortable position. They also put pressure on the outer few metatarsals, one of which I broke years ago, so the break site is aggravated by the odd pressure. I'm also not a fan of how thick the band is going over the foot. They are hot and sweaty since feet\/skin can't breath wrapped in so much plastic.","1320":"I would buy again. One size smaller. Very wide. I wear wide to double wide and these are very wide..goid for me","1321":"These kind of resemble my Crocs I love so much. They aren't much too look at, but make up for it in comfort. My feet really do appreciate the squishy pillows and they are exactly what I was looking for in a pair of house slippers. .","1322":"Ordered normal size based on info posted about this shoe. Sandal was extremely wide. Definitely unsafe to wear due to large size. Returning.","1323":"Ordered my usual size but are too big. My feet are quite wide and they are even too wide. Too ugly to wear to work. I'm too lazy to return them. Will wear around the house. I'll bet they will really help with leg and feet pain.","1324":"So my daughter suprised me by saying these shoes are trending online. I cannot imagine a universe where I\u2019d wear these out of the house. But I guess if you\u2019re goregeous and 19 you can wear pizza boxes on your feet.I bought these after reading the comfort reviews, and that is soooo true, incredibly comfortable!. These have no arch support per se, but they still are great around the house, or when standing for long periods. Wear with thin socks or bare feet. Just anticipate ugly. 2 inch thick Herman Munster sole, big ol rectangular shaped pink slide that is literally two squeakers away from being clown shoes.","1325":"So soft and comfortable. Will recommend to friends","1326":"These slides are very soft and easy to just throw on for a quick trip outside or around the house. But they fit smaller so I would suggest buying a larger size. But other than that they fit pretty nice.","1327":"Just standing still they are very comfortable but when walking my feet slide forward and I don\u2019t feel supported.","1328":"Not a complete feeling of comfort","1329":"It\u2019s like walking on pillows. Very comfortable.","1330":"These run big. I wear size 7.5-8. Bought size 8, it was big. Gave it to my daughter who wears size 9. Bought size 7.5 it was still big, had to return it. Bought size 7, these were small. I had to return it. And just gave up.","1331":"Although they run a bit small (I'm a men's 12), they are really comfortable! I love using them while working at home. It got me some time to get used to the feeling of walking on them, but they are great!","1332":"they\u2019re a little stiff at first but so comfy after wearing them for awhile","1333":"Color was exactly what shown","1334":"I love these! So cute and comfy!","1335":"It said order your regular size. I did. They are huge!Especially the top band. If you have wide, swollen feet, these would be perfect. Not sure ordering a size down will fix that.","1336":"I wanted to love these because of the color, but the top band is too big. Therefore, my foot slides to the front too much . I tried","1337":"Est\u00e1n super suaves.Yo lo agarre por mi embarazo y el soporte es como lo esperaba.","1338":"I loved these so much I even got a 2nd pair... but I took them off at the pool and they literally shrank 2 sizes being oustide. Can't get them back on and holding them up to the other pair they are comically smaller now. They do not reform out of the sun so my first pair is ruined. Guess they're not great outdoor shoes... lol","1339":"I wanted to love these, but as others mentioned they run really small. While they are cushiony, they make my ankles hurt in the strangest way. I think they are cute and can wear for short periods around the house\u2026but I\u2019d never wear them when having to walk any substantial bit.","1340":"Love these! Bought for my husband after he would steal mine! He hates to admits it but they are his favorite sandals!","1341":"These are extremely comfortable, but I recommend ordering a size down. They are HUGE!","1342":"They fit well and feel good. So far so good.","1343":"The thick soles are cushiony and comfortable!  A great purchase for those of us who may have issues with their feet.  This shoe does not provide arch support, however, it is a very comfortable shoe and slipper for me since I am unable to go barefoot on any surface. I would highly recommend these and I will be ordering another pair to wear outside.","1344":"These are so comfortable,  great fit everyday use!","1345":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0Was skeptical on what ones to buy since there are so many brands. But I could not be more glad I got these. I have both this brand and the cushionair, these ones are definitely more comfortable. 10\/10 would recommend!","1346":"Bought these for my gf.\u201d Best gift I ever got her\u201d That\u2019s great I guess\u2026 but  Apparently it\u2019s true like walking on clouds and great foot support to front and arches according to her.","1347":"The most comfortable shoe!!! So soft and squishy!","1348":"These are super comfortable.","1349":"Good for the price and usage. Not much support if that\u2019s what you are looking for.","1350":"I love these am on my feet all day for work and when I put these on when I get home my feet didn't hurt at all anymore.  I wish I had shoes like these","1351":"loving how it feels to walk in these slides but im just a bit disappointed that i selected the size i wore but received the shoe and it was a bit too small so my heel is hanging off the back","1352":"Outstanding product for after foot surgery. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d","1353":"I use have keep the slippers at my friends house because she has wood floors but they are so comfortable it feels like walking on a cloud and i love it","1354":"All I am going to say is I have ankle pain all the time, and needed that comfort of a squish airy feel for my foot, and these are such life savers! They feel very comfortable when I have them on and feels like I am walking on air. They are thick which is why the platform is airy.","1355":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0I Love these slides!! They are so soft and cushiony, I work a lot and when the pressure points of my feet start to hurt I change into my slides and the pain leaves quickly! I ordered my regular shoe size and the fit true to size and I can wear them with and without socks.. They arrived in a couple days of ordering and the packaging was appropriate for what it was meant for.I definitely recommend ordering these slides because They are what they say they are! I am in the process of ordering another pair in a different color right now!","1356":"Very wide","1357":"Softer than other pairs I\u2019ve tried!,","1358":"I was so excited about these shoes.  Only to get them and they were so big that it was laughable.  I\u2019m NO way do they run true to size.  If you order size almost 2 sizes down THATS how big they run.  Unbelievable.  I was so excited because they are SO cozy.  But they do not fit at all:(","1359":"Not bad, but for me Oofo slides are the way to go.","1360":"These slides are super comfortable, but also provide great support.  Just ordered a second pair.","1361":"These sandals would have been wonderful, but I ordered my usual size and they were far too large. The smaller size was not available. Bummer!","1362":"They are just as disrobed by the seller.","1363":"Seriously the comfiest slides ever!!","1364":"They felt good, I will order a smaller size","1365":"I was looking for yeezy cloud alternatives and this shoe is soo soft and comfortable. I was able to walk all day in them with no fatigue. Truly feels as if I am walking on cloud 9.","1366":"Walking on clouds","1367":"This product did not disappoint.","1368":"I absolutely loved these sandals at first! Unfortunately after my first time wearing them to the beach they got wet, and overnight they completely shrank. They fit so well the first time I wore them but now they\u2019re so small they don\u2019t fit, and I only got to wear them once.","1369":"These are very comfortable. I can wear them all day around the house and my feet don't hurt","1370":"These shoes are durable & comfortable!","1371":"Love these slippers!!! have now purchased several more for other family members and myself.","1372":"Excelente material","1373":"This is the perfect summer slipper. They are very comfortable and squishy but still provide support. I was a little concerned my feet would sweat in them but they do not.","1374":"Got these for my husband so he would stop walking around in socks or other sandals that pick up hair and get into bed with which was driving me crazy. He was complaining about ordering these and now he Loves them and I even wear his and I\u2019m going to get some in my size. Very comfortable and able to wash them. Great buy","1375":"He liked them for shower shoes for the dorm but has not used them yet.","1376":"These slides are so comfy and light. I just wear them around my place. Want to get more colors","1377":"Comfortable!","1378":"I\u2019m usually a 7 in most shoes and I definitely could have used a 7.5. They are wearable but small!","1379":"It\u2019s hard  overemphasize the cushiness factor. Nothing compares to the feeling you\u2019ll have when you put these on. I wish I could wear then to work!  Love, love, love.","1380":"So comfortable!!","1381":"Support, comfort & softness. I love it!","1382":"Thought I would use them as slippers but I\u2019ve actually worn them out and got loads of compliments!! May order another pair in a different color!!","1383":"Perfect thick soft cushion slide for my plantar fasciitis. Instant comfort. I love them. I\u2019m ready to buy another pair. The VERY BEST I\u2019ve tried.","1384":"You'll love them, trust me","1385":"These run a FULL size small.I'm a US Mens size 12. I bought the mens 11.5-12.5. Not EVEN close...","1386":"Good slippers it\u2019s perfect for walking but you can\u2019t walk in it for more that 10-15 mins, your feets sides start hurting","1387":"You have to wear socks if you have bunions on your feet","1388":"Love the softness, fits as expected. I\u2019m size 6 but wanted a little more room for my pregnant swollen feet :)","1389":"These are great. Feels like your walking on clouds.","1390":"I\u2019ve tried several (more $$$) brands of sandals and slippers, these beat them all in how soft and comfy they are.","1391":"I had high hopes after reading lots of reviews, but they did not fit as expected and were too narrow for my wide toe box. I would size up if I got these again even though my size was within the range I bought.","1392":"These slippers are so comfortable and soft, I always look forward to putting them on especially after a long day on my feet. They are definitely a great purchase, I love them!","1393":"Super comfortable. Fits true to size. Love the color. States brown but is light tan.","1394":"Plan on getting more colors","1395":"I\u2019m a hardcore croc wearer, but wanted something that looked a little different but still gave me the comfort of my crocs. These are the perfect replacement and fit true to size, very glad I gave them a try.","1396":"Shoes were just what I wanted. Very comfy, slip on shoes.","1397":"I bought these slippers for my daughter who has problems with her feet.  If you or yours have foot problems buy these slippers!  She is over the moon in love with these slippers!  To quote:  OMG they are soooo comfortable!!!!  Thank you!!!!","1398":"Great for my home! Tile floors! Support! Already makes my feet and knee feel better! I work from home so it\u2019s and easy shoe to wear around the house! I think they are ugly but they work!","1399":"My second pair of these and I love them so much!!!!","1400":"I don\u2019t get the hype over this shoe. When I actually ordered a pair and saw them in person I couldn\u2019t believe how cheap they look. I was so disappointed to say the least. They truly are ugly rubber shower shoes. Honestly, when I saw them I thought they looked like jail shoes you see the inmates wear at my job. Then, to top it off, the shoe sizes are huge. I wear a size 8.5 so I ordered the 7 to 8 1\/2 shoe size. My foot was still  swimming in these ugly rubber clown shoes! The sizing is way off. You need to order 2 sizes down for a proper fit. In fact, I ordered two pair thinking I would like them. They were both huge. Also, the first pair arrived packaged in a plastic bag, stacked on top of each other so they were all smashed up. The second pair arrived in a box with tissue paper. Very inconsistent. After I received  the shoes I couldn\u2019t believe the instructions on this company\u2019s Amazon\u2019s page. To get a blow dryer, put it up to the highest heat setting and basically melt the shoe onto your foot while wearing 2 pairs of socks - how hilarious is that? Melt the cheap plastic so it fits your foot? Unbelievable.\ud83d\ude44 I will be returning these penitentiary style shower shoes ASAP.","1401":"Bulky, sloppy ok for piddling around house not for out in public.","1402":"They are pretty comfortable! They have a thick sole and are pretty soft on my feet. They look darker than on the picture but these are just house slippers so I\u2019m good with it.Love them!","1403":"I loooove these. I wear a size 6 in shoes so I got Women\u2019s 6-7. But I recommend going down to the 5.5 size if you wear a 6!! The 6-7\u2019s are a little big for me!","1404":"The slip on cloud shoes are awesome! I've had a sore heel n it helps tremendously! I bought them to just knock around the house n they're my favorite slip ONS by far!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f","1405":"Love these shoes, they are so comfortable.  They run a little wide, love the soft and squishy feel!","1406":"These shoes are so comfortable! So convenient to slip on and wear all day! Inside as house shoes or outside! The only issue is they do run small the size is a little off. I would suggest going up one size.","1407":"So comfy\u2014feels like you are walking on foam\u2014which I guess you are!","1408":"Super squishy and comfortable.Beware that they become very uncomfortable when wet. You sort of slip and squeak in the shoe. I do not recommend to use while wet.Otherwise they\u2019re great!","1409":"Product arrived in a timely manner, very nice looking but were HUGE.  I wear a size 8 and purchased a size 8.  A lot of reviews said they ran small but I definitely disagree.  I had another family member with a foot size of 10 try them on and they fit perfect.  I returned these for a refund and would not reorder","1410":"I wouldn\u2019t waste my money. They actually make my feet hurt. I had to throw mine in the dryer because I have a very narrow foot, the dryer helped shrink them down. So if you have a wide foot you shouldn\u2019t have any problems with the fit. The were true to size other then being really wise. The color is cute I ordered the pink ones. They\u2019re just not comfortable in my opinion.","1411":"It was a gift for my mom, and she love it","1412":"All i can say is Wow! I wish i would habe found these babies sooner. I have plantar fasciitis on both feet and it has been hard to find suitable slippers. These slippers feel like im walking on clouds. They are lightweight and easily washable.","1413":"That\u2019s it. Just buy them!","1414":"Comfort is amazing!  Size just runs big!","1415":"These are really soft, but they did hurt my bunions.","1416":"These feel like you are walking on clouds and my husband and I are obsessed. Will be ordering multiple pairs.","1417":"The bed of the sandal was very squishy so it didn't have much support. When walking it felt bouncy rather than supportive so not for plantar fasciitis feet. If you want super softness then these are the ones for you but the softness does not equal comfort for me. The foot bed also felt crooked when wearing around the house. I was constantly trying to readjust my foot inside the sandal but there was nothing wrong, it was just the placement of the foot bed. Maybe just a defect in my pair? I've returned for a refund so I can look for a better fit for my needs.","1418":"These are super comfortable to wear around the house! I also really like that the inside has a little bit of grip; it makes it so I can wear socks with them without worrying about my feet slipping around.","1419":"Comfortable","1420":"The media could not be loaded.","1421":"When you first wear these they feel a little funky, almost a little like they are on the wrong feet.  But after wearing them a day or two they almost mold to your feet and are the most comfortable slippers I have ever had.","1422":"I feel these aren\u2019t as comfortable as advertised. They rub on your foot and after a awhile ( few hours) make a sore spot on my foot. I thought of wearing them only as slippers but even a short time the top of my foot was sore. Think these need to be returned. Sadly disappointed","1423":"Usually wear an 11M but ordered 11.5-12.5M and they fit perfect and are SUPER comfortable. I will be recommending these to all my friends men and women alike","1424":"Very comfy and stylish! Reasonable price!","1425":"The slippers are very big and firm, I am a size 11 and they fit more like a size 12-13 with way too much room on the over-strap. Was very disappointed","1426":"I will say that these shoes are soft, but I have plantar fasciitis and they actually hurt the inside of my feet, all the way to my big toe. I would love if they had a Wide version. I wish I could find shoes that make my feet feel better \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d","1427":"I love love these sandals. My feet feel like they are in heaven..","1428":"Great comfortable shoes.  Helps my hurting feet.","1429":"I wanted them as a house slipper.  I do use them as such. But find they cut into the top of my foot, a bit.  The material could be more flexible, or softer.","1430":"So soft like walking on clouds!","1431":"My slippers","1432":"These felt super comfy when I tried them on, but disappointed that they are too big for my feet.  Besides the sizing issue, they seem like they would have been great.","1433":"Super soft sooo comfy","1434":"I ordered these to wear around the house but I will be wearing them everywhere. SO comfortable and cushy. 10\/10 recommend.","1435":"I will be ordering more colors","1436":"Friend of mine recommended these and in surprised at how comfortable they are!","1437":"LOVE these shoes. So comfortable. Literally like walking on clouds! Ended up sending a pair to my sister and mom also!","1438":"The color is great.  They are super comfortable.  They do run a bit large.","1439":"The color is not dark brown. More of a light brown.The slide itself runs short in length. Go up a size or two or your heels will hang off the back or your front toes will touch the top of the front. Bottom line: disappointing slide.","1440":"I love everything about these","1441":"Really great slides. Very comfy.","1442":"My daughter loved these shoes!! They\u2019re so very soft but still have support!! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb","1443":"I\u2019ve had surgery on my feet and wash looking for a saddle actually comfortable. This is it!","1444":"My friend said these were like jail shoes\u2014 I\u2019ve never been but I\u2019m INTO THESE!They\u2019re so comfortable and bouncy. I use them as house slippers and they have great traction!I also have wider feet and they have definitely filled out to fit my foot comfortably, not that they were tight at all when I got them!","1445":"Absolutely the only shoes I want to wear Ever! Buy a size down, they spread!","1446":"Fits as expected. The most comfortable sandal. Worth the money.","1447":"I purchased these shoes because I needed something really soft under my feet. They fit as described and felt really good on the bottom of my feet. I would definitely buy these again.","1448":"Love love these shoes. I wear them around the house. I also bought these to wear at the beach & on the boat! They are supper comfortable. You won\u2019t be disappointed if you buy.","1449":"Amazing quality they fit perfect when I got them but keep in mind they stretch (well mines did) but other than that amazing, comfortable and def worth the money","1450":"These shoes are cute and comfortable but very wide.  I definitely think they are sized for men.In general, size 11 fits well, length & width.I ordered the 10.5-11.5.  Length is great, but they are wide enough I don\u2019t think I could keep them on my feet while walking.(Please ignore the sad state of my feet in the photos!)","1451":"I love the color they fit as expected they\u2019re very comfortable","1452":"This product is not the same color as the picture. I\u2019m referring to the GI Joe colored green. It\u2019s a not so nice colored poop green. It also is a huge and not accurate in sizing.","1453":"They\u2019re extremely comfortable and cute. I do plan on buying a few more.","1454":"They were a wanted gift.","1455":"The sandals got wet so when I got home I left them in the sun to dry.  A short time later, I brought them in and they were too tight to easily slide my foot in AND they were so short that my heel stuck out the back by an inch.  They had fit perfectly before drying.","1456":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0I like it a lot, the softness makes my wide feet comfortable l. Highly recommended. I will buy again","1457":"If you don\u2019t have a pair - you should! Super comfy and durable!","1458":"I had foot surgery and thought these would be great.  They are but, they run large ... So order a size smaller.","1459":"It\u2019s so comfy","1460":"These shoes are kinda fun bc they look ridiculous and slightly ugly. But one of those \u201cthey\u2019re cute bc they\u2019re ugly\u201d kinda things. They\u2019re comfortable in a sense bc they\u2019re pretty squooshy. But uncomfortable to wear more than to take the dog out - bc they\u2019re made of pretty much just rubber, so they caused a lot a blisters and haven\u2019t went away in like a month. Ouch and ick. So I only wear them for like 10-15m at a time now and have to wear socks sometimes bc the friction of the rubber gets a little painful. I was going to get a few other colors but after trying to wear them for errands - heck no.","1461":"So cute and comfy. Shrunk when I was poolside and left them in the sun :(","1462":"Very comfortable","1463":"We got these for our Daughter-in-law for Christmas and she loves them. She had another pair of them already but the dog chewed them up and she was heartbroken. She was so excited to have some again. She says they are so comfortable and soft.","1464":"It\u2019s soft but not firm","1465":"A little larger then I wanted but does the job ! Such comfy sandals to wear around the house","1466":"They are very comfortable and I love the color","1467":"Great product","1468":"If I could I would wear these all the time! They are soooooo comfortable!","1469":"Relief from hip and back pain. I feel like I am walking on a super comfortable kitchen floor memory Floormat","1470":"Please do not  leave these shoes in a direct light with fairly warm temperature above 90 degrees. When I accidentally left then outside, one of the two shoes shrank. not both, but one for some reason. Wonderful comfy shoes, but got 2 stars for not warning label about heat and shrinking these shoes","1471":"Love these. I have them in different colors but they are very very wide. Perfect for someone with swollen feet. I have a normal width foot. So buy a size or two smaller and wear Sox\u2019s","1472":"I only gave it a 2 star because the cushion on these is great however.. the material itself isn't comfortable at all, it digged in my skins within minutes of wearing them and they don't fit snagged at all.","1473":"Would be a perfect 5 if there was a choice or way to adjust the width.","1474":"The product suggested how to size and I followed this suggestion.  They are soft .. zero support .. and very big across the top.  I used the manufacturer method to shrink the upper with a blow dryer and they are very uncomfortable.  Trendy but I didn\u2019t have the same experience that many other people have apparently- back they go.","1475":"Perfect slipper, have bought for friends","1476":"The comfort is good, but they fit a little too bulky to walk. Ordered the usual size, but there too wide for walking","1477":"Want some in another color and one size small. Great shower shoes","1478":"I like them","1479":"The bottom of the shoe is very comfy (not as squishy as i had wanted tho), however the top arch of the shoe is bent flat and hurts the top of my foot when i step. This is the second pair I\u2019ve received after having to first return for them being too small (i\u2019m a size 7, had to order the 9-10), and both pairs came with the top part being bent due to how they stack them to ship (see pic). I\u2019m returning again and probably gonna find something in store :(","1480":"I couldn\u2019t wait to make these slides a summer staple in multiple colors; however when I put mine on they were HUGE. They are super soft and super cute but because they are so large I\u2019m going to replace them with a size down.","1481":"Super comfortable! And looks like the picture.","1482":"Very very nice","1483":"These are so very comfortable that I wore them every day until the temperature made my toes turn blue from cold.  I wanted red, but they don't come in red, so I decided on gray, but gray was out of stock, so I got the pink. After I put them on, I decided that pink works just fine. They are sturdy and waterproof and my husband wants a pair, but they don't come in men's size 13. Alas!  You will not regret your decision to purchase these.","1484":"Very comfortable and literally feels like walking on clouds \ud83d\udc4d","1485":"Gift","1486":"Love how they are spongy, washable and not heavy on the foot.","1487":"This slipper is like walking on a cloud. Comfortable with great thick sole. My favorite so far!","1488":"I wear a size  12 woman\u2019s and have mild arthritis in my feet. These are so comfortable and offer some support. Will get a second color.","1489":"Exelentes","1490":"I read the reviews and debated what size to get, but I decided I would rather them be a little too big rather than too small. I\u2019m normally a size 10 in shoes so I went for the 10.5-11.5, which seemed like a big jump to me but honestly the shoes are perfect. The length is just right. They\u2019re perfect with and without socks. I\u2019m wearing them all over the place and I think they\u2019re so cute and trendy. I want to order more, I\u2019m just worried about sizing variation with the different colors. Hope this helps!","1491":"Very comfortable, fit accurate as advertised","1492":"These are so soft and comfortable, like walking on clouds!","1493":"Excellent product!","1494":"The best slippers, so soft, & comfy, the size is all right \ud83d\udc4d","1495":"I ordered my shoe size. What came was loose on my foot, too wide all around, and not too comfortable if I stood up in them for a bit, such as when conversing with someone. After a few minutes, my foot became aware that it was standing on top of the strap. Why? Couldn't the strap fit into the sole, rather than come on top of it? At any rate, I will not order more of these.","1496":"I like this product because they are comfortable to walk around in.  I only use them in the house.  After a long day of wearing shoes it is nice to put these on at the end of the day.","1497":"Whatever you do do not leave your sandals in the sun. I left my sandals on the porch and the afternoon sun hit them. When I remembered and went to get them the next morning they shrunk so bad my feet could not even get into them! I was so disappointed! They were so nice for the time I did get to wear them though.","1498":"Great support and comfort to my aching feet. These are awesome!","1499":"I\u2019m normal height 5\u20197 weight 140 and foot width medium, the wide top strap makes feet slide sideways in shoe while wearing, also the bottom has no insole or cloth at all so little hard beads dig into bottoms of feet while walking in summer I\u2019d imagine it\u2019d be sticky and sweaty,they could be ok if a few upgrades were done, definitely not cloud or pillow like comfort. Maybe worth $10 the way they are for shower shoe or something.","1500":"I wear a women's 7 1\/2 but the first pair were huge. I returned thru Kohls- super easy and reordered the next smaller size. They arrived today and fit perfectly. I have only owned them a short time but they feel so comfortable. Like walking on air! Fit well even with socks.","1501":"Hands down the most comfortable slides I\u2019ve ever worn. They\u2019re not the most fashionable but with this comfort level I don\u2019t really mind.","1502":"I ordered a pair almost 2 years ago, they are all I wore at home. I absolutely love them, and I don't have any foot pain at all anymore. I just got my brand new pair. I was diagnosed with \"plantars foot\" and these shoes was my savior... I just received my second pair, AND... I received them on time Christmas Eve day. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f","1503":"These are fantastic slippers! They are so comfortable. They are water proof and I love the way you can heat them up and mold them to your feet.","1504":"Really comfortable durable I love themThis is my third pair I have a beige pair a brown pair and a red pair love them so comfortable","1505":"I don't like sandals\/slippers without a heel strap but gave these a try.  Sure enough, I easily come out of them while walking normally.  I have to walk a certain way to keep them on my feet.  If my feet are wet & I walk a few steps, I can easily slip out of them or even find them flipping around onto the top of my foot, twisting my ankle in the process.  That said, they are comfortable if I'm just standing in them or not moving much.  I wanted the white color because I live in the desert & black absorbs the heat.  They're OK, just be careful with them.","1506":"Product runs very big. However, they are very comfy. You can find them cheaper elsewhere.","1507":"These are super comfy and cute with a great price.","1508":"Product fits true to size and it feels like you\u2019re walking on an ergo\/anti-fatigue mat which is great for people who have low back pain or are pregnant! I bought these to help give me more support during my 2nd pregnancy just walking around the house and they\u2019ve been great, also will be great for the hospital since they\u2019re waterproof and can be used in the shower.","1509":"These are amazing comfortable and wide enough for anyone.  Bought them for shower showes because I couldn't find a shower mat to help with my aching feet.  And this was the perfect solution!  Couldn't be happier with this purchase","1510":"As comfortable as they were the fit is horrible...not sure why you would make the fit so lose.  Disappointed and no i do not recommend","1511":"I would definitely buy another pair, so comfortable to wear around the house or anywhere! I choose a bigger size so I can wear thick thermal socks with them. These would be a great gift idea for anyone!","1512":"Yaaaaas, honey! Yaaaas! These are FAB! I wear steel toe shoes 10hrs a day and when I tell you that I have achy feet, I\u2019m not lyin\u2019. So, kickin off those ol clunkers and slidin into these sweet babies feels like Heaven. My feet are wide and I\u2019ve started to develop the dreaded Old Lady bunion on my right foot and the 10.5 is perfect ; snug enough to feel secure but with enough give to not feel binding. Don\u2019t even hesitate, order these sandals. I\u2019m gonna be ordering another pair, for sure.","1513":"These slides are A1! They're comfortable, affordable, and look great too. Couldn't be happier with this purchase","1514":"really comfortable to wear at home. They are so big looking - kind of cartoony-with thick soul that really cushions.  I would only wear them outside at the beach or pool or something fun. In the house, it is squishy comfort. I really love them.","1515":"En general la calidad es buena, son muy bonitas. La raz\u00f3n por la que no doy 5 estrellas es, porque les faltan tallas, donde quedamos quienes usamos 8.5 ? 7-8.5 son muy peque\u00f1as y 9-9.5 son muy grandes, tristemente solicit\u00e9 mi devoluci\u00f3n. El color te de leche es precioso.","1516":"Going to the swimming pools","1517":"I love these so much! Their the Uggs of summer haha they\u2019re so comfy and I love how they look","1518":"These are very comfortable shoes. However, I stopped wearing after a few days when I noticed the strong chemical smell sticks to anything that touches it, including my feet. I didn't feel like returning them and just left them in my closet. After a few weeks\/months, I was surprised to find that the smell actually faded quite a bit. I started wearing them again, and they are my favorite slippers to wear around the house.","1519":"I wear a size 6-6 1\/2 so I got the size 6-7. They are too big so it looks like I\u2019m a kid wearing my moms shoes lolI\u2019m not convinced these are super comfortable. They are super lightweight and cushiony, but the jury is out on how great they are.Meh.","1520":"It's great for your feet but the reason for that is because all the pressure goes to your knees. The few days I used these slides, my knees started jacking up and my joints were rubbing hard against each other. I repeat, do not get these if you have knee problems or want knee problems.","1521":"These slip ons are so comfortable.  After a long day, putting these on is just what my feet need.  This is my second pair!","1522":"Perfect in every way","1523":"I was very excited to receive these but was so bummed out when the women's size 12\/13 was too small. I fully expected them to be too big but they were the only option for my size 12 foot.They also will definitely rub and create blisters on my feet if I wear them without socks.Not worth the money","1524":"Roomy enough for the bunions","1525":"Going to return . Runs larger. Wider. Had defect on one shoe.","1526":"These things are clumsy, clunky and HARD. NOT comfortable at all! But they will serve my purpose of slip ins when I take my dogs out to the backyard. Glad I did not order 2 pair. Not worth it. \u2639\ufe0f","1527":"The first cloud slide I bought from them lived up to its name. It was soft and helped ease my pain from plantar fasciitis. This one that I recently got was so hard, it should not be called cloud slippers. Very sad that they reduced their quality, will be returning the one I just bought.","1528":"I was e cited to try these sandals and disappointed that they run big. They look too bulky and cheaply made, when they are $25! Not worth returning to China. Will buy from another vendor.","1529":"Very cushy, comfortable... would order another pair just a size smaller","1530":"I have wide feet. The bed of the slipper is wide which is good but the part that goes over the top of the foot rubs on the side. Don\u2019t know if it will stretch out. Also the cushion is so soft it affects my balance slightly as I walk. If balance is a problem in general I would avoid these.","1531":"Bought them for my wife and she loves them.","1532":"This one is heavier and more cushiony than the other pillow slipper brands I\u2019ve tried. It\u2019s more supportive and the rubber isn\u2019t as stiff. It is more pliable. It\u2019s super comfy and makes my post partum feet feel supported. My mom, niece, grandma & 3 aunts all wanted a pair after I got one.","1533":"worth it..","1534":"Very comfy for around the house and wide enough to slip my feet in with double socks.","1535":"Really thick great support makes it easier to walk when I\u2019m in pain I\u2019m ordering another pair ASAP","1536":"It\u2019s so soft! Perfect for Tired feet","1537":"Very comfy","1538":"These are soo Comfortable and soft but they are huge there about two sizes too big","1539":"Comfy, durable, and stylish. What\u2019s more to know?","1540":"The sizing is weird but for me. The length was just right. It was just too loose fitting. Like, the strap itself was too big.","1541":"I love this product very supportive and durable.","1542":"Super cushions for your feet!","1543":"The flooring in my home is SPC which is hard and it made my feet hurt so I bought this one and makes my feet pain free finally!","1544":"These are so freaking comfy","1545":"This slid is very comfy, pillow like. Really good support. It\u2019s just not the best for wide feet. I think eventually as I wear them they will be a better rift. But not so much in the getting to know you stage","1546":"Get it.. help my plantar Fasciitis!! Getting another one","1547":"Buy these. Durable and incredibly soft to walk in.","1548":"Comfortable and soft","1549":"So so soooo comfortable! Get them!","1550":"Not the cutest footwear in my opinion, but super comfortable and great for those quick trips outside, to walk the dog, check the mail, etc. True to size, but if you\u2019re worried, I\u2019d size up.","1551":"They aren't bad but I don't really trust walking on them.","1552":"Holds lots of water when you get out of shower needs drain holes in the soles.  Easy fix ,,, drilled a few holes.","1553":"These are WITHOUT A DOUBT the most comfortable slides I\u2019ve ever worn! They also are durable, I\u2019ve had them quite a while, worn them in snow, dirt, rocks, etc, and I see no visible damage to the slipper. You won\u2019t regret buying these!!","1554":"These are so soft and cushy yet very supportive for my feet.  I\u2019ve worn them around my house every day for over a week.  I ordered thinking they\u2019d help my chronic knee pain and I can say they have! I\u2019ll be ordering more so I\u2019ll have some to switch up.  I ordered the black, and will add some other colors next.  I highly recommend them.  They are super affordable too!","1555":"Very comfortable shoe to hang around the house","1556":"Super comfortable ! Fit just right but not too much extra room so it may run a bit small for others. My shoe size ranges from 4.5-5. But for me it was just right (:","1557":"Pleasantly surprised. These were so comfortable\u2026I\u2019m about to buy a pair for my sister as well.","1558":"I do wish these came in individual sizes. I usually wear a 10\u2026These accommodate sizes 9&10\u2026I\u2019m at a slight disadvantage\u2014a kind of Goldilocks dilemma. Still a good product however.","1559":"I love these slippers. I have small feet and they actually fit. They really are like walking on a cloud. I plan to purchase more.","1560":"Neuropathy.","1561":"I\u2019ve been hearing people rave about these slippers for months and I finally bit the bullet and purchased them. They aren\u2019t at all as I expected them to be.  They are not squishy and cloud like at all. I loved the color but they aren\u2019t as cushiony as everyone claimed that they are.  I won\u2019t be keeping these.","1562":"Run large and are loose on my feet. They are very cushy and comfortable, but they just slop around as I walk and my foot slides forward, out of the sole area. I wear a women's size 6 and ordered according to their chart.","1563":"I was surprised they are supper comfortable except after regular wearing I experienced some rubbing  on the side of my foot from the slipper but I would recommend","1564":"Me encanta son maravillosos. Ya e comprado 3 a mi family","1565":"ordered my size but it is too big and it has a wide opening so my feet slide out!","1566":"They feel great","1567":"Very light and comfortable slipper! Love it\u2019s worthy.","1568":"They were much smaller than the size listed. Couldn\u2019t wear them at all. Gave them to my daughter. She said they hurt her feet but she had worn them so I couldn\u2019t return them.","1569":"I ordered these a while back in pink for myself and raved about how comfortable they were to my husband. I finally order him a pair and me another pair and they are not the same at all! The new pairs I got are so stiff! Absolutely not the same comfort level or quality that they were. I made sure I ordered the exact brand. We were expecting them to be exactly like the ones I already own, but they\u2019re not. Just a cheapened look-alike product.","1570":"Cute and comfortable!","1571":"Like them very soft and comfy. Would buy again","1572":"So comfortable!! Wear them all the time at home.","1573":"These are the most comfortable things ever","1574":"I purchased a size 7.5-8.5 in the nude color. I normally wear a size 8, and they\u2019re too small. Weird since it\u2019s suppose to fit up to a size 8.5","1575":"Slippers DO shrink on sun.Just for information, my pair of Slippers DID shrink on sun when I left it out on porch for a week or so. Had to return.","1576":"I had ordered both the yellow and the pink in both a size 7. The yellow one arrived first and fit well and was comfortable but the pink that arrived had the same size written on the bottom of the shoe but was smaller as shown in the picture. The shoe length sizes are uneven and unfortunately the shoe in the same pink color 1 size up is currently out of stock.","1577":"These are super confortable and cute! Perfect for around the house","1578":"I had high hopes from all the positive hipe.  However, it really didn't help my hurting feet.  Not sure I will wear them very much as they are too tall.  This product could be improved by making it about 1\/2 the current sole height as some people with foot problems also have balance problems.  And by making it smooth inside where your foot contacts the shoe.  It has a hash mark type of pattern inside (maybe for slip prevention?) that I found almost unbearable on the bottom of my foot even with socks on.","1579":"Bonito  color","1580":"Love these! So comfy that my 12 year old took mine and I had to order a second pair!!","1581":"I bought these about 6 months ago and the wear and tear is awesome. They fit perfectly and the comfort is the same as when I first put them on. These are worth the money!","1582":"Feet sweat but very comfortable when back from work.","1583":"I really wanted to love these, but...there was so much space from the top of my foot and the strap. I couldn't get past it so had to return.","1584":"Runs smaller than indicated on show size chart Seems like Asian size measurements","1585":"Runs about half a size little small","1586":"The shoes are very comfortable, but they make my feet sweat.","1587":"I like that they're comfortable slippers to wear around my house being that I'm on my feet majority of the day","1588":"The size is a bit smaller and not as cushiony \/ soft as the 2 pairs reviously ordered, a little disappointing. The first pairs were heavenly... like, \"walking on clouds\" as many mention","1589":"So comfy !!' And stylish ! Probably going to buy it in more colors !","1590":"","1591":"These are so comfortable","1592":"Gift","1593":"I\u2019m a 200 lb six foot dude. I have Plantar Fasciitis in my left foot. Thought these might help. After wearing them around the house for two days I\u2019ve decided to send them back. My left foot has more pain now. Just sitting in my computer chair, my feet were going numb. They feel squishy when your full weight is on them but they\u2019re pretty hard otherwise. I tried to use the hair dryer to soften them up and \u201cmold\u201d them to my feet, but didn\u2019t think that really did much.","1594":"Gifted for Mother's day. Bought the smallest size and it was still a little too big for her but she likes it. Stepdad wants a pair too!","1595":"Have had the slides for a few months now. After leaving outside on a shady day maybe 89 degrees they shrunk up an no longer fit. It\u2019s very disappointing.","1596":"This slide is soft and very comfortable. The look isn\u2019t the cutest but that doesn\u2019t matter because of the comfort.","1597":"The bottoms are comfortable but the top that holds my foot in place is far too big for my average size 7 foot. My feet slide around and when wet they are super unstable.","1598":"They\u2019re comfy and came fast, but I\u2019ve only worn them once and they\u2019re already dirty. Also runs big, probably order a half size down.","1599":"Love these, they help so much!","1600":"They are comfortable but the color in the picture makes it look like it\u2019s olive green, but they\u2019re more of a brown color instead.","1601":"These are exactly what I wanted. They aren\u2019t the prettiest things I\u2019ve ever seen but, I didn\u2019t get them to be fashionable. I got them to have something comfortable to wear around the house and these are it!","1602":"The slides look good but have far less cushion and comfort than the original pillow slides.","1603":"They were huge. Sending them back. I'm a 6.5 ordered 6-7, could have fit 2 of me in there. Disappointed","1604":"So comfy. My husband and I wear them strictly inside and they are sooooo great!","1605":"Around the house slides. Have been in them since the day I got them","1606":"Yes, soft to walk on but really big.  My feet slip in them then my toes are hanging over the front then walking in them is not comfortable.  If the were tighter maybe helpful.  Understandable they are men\u2019s & women\u2019s sizes so just too big for me.  Kept them because I thought I would just wear them around the house & just adjust the way I walk in them but even around the house I slip around in them.","1607":"I love how comfy they are. I dont know if I bought a size too big, but I can't walk far without having to push my feet back in the slide. Its very annoying. Im an 8 and I got the 7.5\/8.5 size. Maybe size down? I'm still keeping them bc I like to wear them around the house","1608":"Very happy with the product","1609":"Love them!!","1610":"I took these on my beach vacation to Mexico. They were great on the sand and gripped to tile floors. They didn't slip or fell slippery. It felt like I was walking on pillows esp after a long travel day.  People are still not used to seeing them but I didn't care. Im going to buy more colors. They are a must for traveling.","1611":"These are great to wear out when doing lots of walking or at home. Feet sweat a little but its expected with hit weather","1612":"These by far have to be the ugliest shoes I\u2019ve ever bought!! They definitely look like something the hospital would give you when you\u2019re not allowed to have laces. I must\u2019ve predicted it because I was in the hospital a week prior. I\u2019d give this purchase a rating of 5 on comfortability. A 0 on style, unless you\u2019re trying to impress the person who only gets grippy socks\u2026and I mean then you\u2019ll be super popular! Will this purchase come in handy in the future? Unclear at this time. Depends upon if I wear these out into public and I\u2019m seen by legit anyone. Then I\u2019ll surely have to go back to grippy sock land!","1613":"I injured my heel and they were the only slides that really reduced my pain when walking. They are super comfortable.","1614":"Very comfortable I\u2019m very impressed. I feel no compact to the ground it helps my knees so much","1615":"Love this! So comfy and no heel pain when I'm wearing it! Bought another pair for my son!","1616":"Now the 5'9 guys can really be 6ft.","1617":"Got these for a beach shoe while I was on vacation and at first they felt so comfortable, but if you get your feet or the shoe a little wet and try to walk on them you end up with blisters on the sides and top of your feet. Definitely put a damper on my trip.","1618":"I normally wear a women\u2019s 7 or 7 1\/2.  I ordered the 6\/7. The length was perfect, but the width was extremely wide as other reviewers mentioned.  I only wore them in my house, but knew I would never be able yo keep them on my feet (and my feet are on the wider side).  They were cushy and soft, but I returned them.","1619":"How can one shoe be so comfy?!!!! These are amazing!!! I am a size 8 and these fit perfect. Can\u2019t wait to wear them all summer.","1620":"Es c\u00f3modo y pr\u00e1ctico","1621":"Bummed they have shrunk for some reason. They aren\u2019t comfortable anymore.","1622":"These shoes are even more comfortable than they look. I\u2019ve worn them every day since I purchased.","1623":"I wear these to and from the basketball court before I put my court shoes on. They are so nice on my knees after I play. The cushion is really soft, you can barely feel the ground underneath you.","1624":"Very comfy","1625":"I ordered 3 pairs returned 2 pairs they run big they quickly refunded my money got 2 pairs replaced all is good","1626":"Super comfy exactly what I wanted but I would size up! I\u2019m always a 7 in every shoe never bigger but had to buy the 7.5-8.5 which fit perfectly.","1627":"Good support for flat feet and arch support. Feet feel really comfortable, use around house.","1628":"Great cushion and support!","1629":"These shoes are beyond amazing! They are like walking on clouds and easy to just wash in the sink so they always look clean.They do run small so definitely go up a size","1630":"Pretty comfy and very supportive kinda like wearing sneakers. Though one huge drawback for me is that the material feels really sticky to the skin and causes some chafing.","1631":"I felt unsteady walking in them.","1632":"Though they are comfortable I can\u2019t wear them in Publix, looks like clown shoes. Why they sent me a size 9 and not an 8 I will never know but they look ridiculous and I\u2019m way to busy to stand in a line at the post office.","1633":"I bought these after trying many styles. I have neuropathy and pain in my feet, and needed a lot of cushioning. These are perfect. They don't wear out, look a bit clunky, but that may be the style right now. Thinking of ordering a backup order in another color. They're a bit pricey, considering they're just rubber. But my feet appreciate them.","1634":"i wear a 7.5 and these are way too big","1635":"Money well spent product came on time the slides are exactly as described. It\u2019s like walking on a cloud. The fit is exact and they are so so so comfortable.","1636":"purrrrrr <333333","1637":"My initial order arrived with the wrong size but the product was so comfortable that I decided to keep it for a gift.","1638":"These do not disappoint. They are so comfortable! I could wear them all day long.","1639":"These are really comfy but they run very small. I wear size 9-9.5 in women\u2019s and I ordered the 9-10 and they are way to small my ankles hang off the back slightly so I don\u2019t ever wear them","1640":"They\u2019re so comfortable! I chose this brand based on reviews of many \u201ccloud slippers\u201d trending now.","1641":"I thought I\u2019d get these just to wear around the house\u2026.NOOOOOO!!! I wear them EVERYWHERE \ud83d\ude06","1642":"High sole but still comfy and good quality","1643":"Feels like you\u2019re walking on air.","1644":"Very comfortable!! And fit as expected!","1645":"these slippers are comfy! just a little wide","1646":"So comfy ,","1647":"Loved these, but sadly too small. Size up!","1648":"These slides are great! They run a tad big, but are super comfortable. Totally worth the price.","1649":"These are amazing! They do run slightly oversized but oversized is trending right now. So comfortable, will be ordering another color!","1650":"Comfy","1651":"I am not a fan of these shoes! They are not as soft, comfortable or supportive as what I thought they would be.","1652":"These shrunk a full shoe size after Getting them wet one time. Returned them.","1653":"Too big .. it supposed to be the same size as the first pair .. these ones are 1\/2 size bigger","1654":"If I could give this more stars for comfort I Would - I can\u2019t even walk on my hard wood without it","1655":"More comfortable than crocs. Who said crocs where comfortable in the first place? I hated them when I got them out of the bag, now they are my preferred  home footwear","1656":"Hard to fit feet that always hurt. I think they are Ugly, but my feet love them","1657":"I love everything about these slippers","1658":"Don't have problems with one foot being appreciably larger than the other, but the left slipper was tight and the right one loose, and a bit longer - sizing printed on soles was the same.  May have been the way it was packed with them jammed one inside the other.  They're wearable and comfortable after a couple of wearings when worn with socks.  Wouldn't buy a second pair of this brand.","1659":"These slides were too wide for me.  They would not stay on my feet.","1660":"Walk around the house","1661":"Super comfortable sandals.  Love it.","1662":"Super comfortable and so cute","1663":"I like it!","1664":"I just got the light pink in the mail and I love them so much!! Extremely comfy! Definitely recommend :)","1665":"They are comfy, but run a size small. Order a size bigger.","1666":"Est\u00e1n bien. Las uso en la casa.","1667":"They shrink in exposure to heat and now they do not fit.","1668":"Great for bad knees!","1669":"Definitely worth checking out","1670":"I usually don\u2019t like hyped up products but wow these are worth it! I wear them around the house and they\u2019re super comfy!","1671":"Seems like I ordered my correct size but it\u2019s still a lot bigger than a normal size six","1672":"I was so excited for these to arrive. They are HUGE!! Order a size down","1673":"Love them","1674":"I love them so much,they\u2019re so soft it\u2019s my go-to shoe for comfort","1675":"Actually too soft. No arch support. Ended up using as house slippers instead.","1676":"They are very comfortable and I look forward to always wearing them. They make me feel better","1677":"I got a stone bruise on my foot - suffered for weeks trying to find a shoe I could walk in wo further damage or pain - I can\u2019t tell you the difference- I can easily walk 10k now a day and not have a problem and allow my foot to heal!  Best buy","1678":"I use it in house slippers and love them.","1679":"I like the thickness of cushion and the comfort of the shoe while wearing  it throughout the house.","1680":"I ordered 2 pair of these. One for myself and one for my daughter. I used the size chart provided, but unfortunately both pair ran small. If you order, be sure to size up.","1681":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0Ordered correct size...got shoes way tooooo large! Ordered a grey....got beige! Nothing was right about this shoe that I ordered.","1682":"I usually wear 8.5 but read some reviews recommending going up a size and so glad I did!! It fits perfectly & it\u2019s so comfortable \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc","1683":"They feel like your walking on memory foam pillows!","1684":"The shoes are amazing its like walking on a comfy  trampoline not to mention the color was very accurate to the examples.

A good house shoe to keep me from bumping my toes against furniture. They are supportive and comfortable.","1687":"Very wide\u2026so many different \u201cbrands\u201d out there","1688":"I ordered the women\u2019s size 7.5-8.6 and damn they just fit.

Dude imma about to buy me 1 more pair. Appreciate the quality. (Also this is the first review i have ever THATS HOW GOOD THEY FEEL WODIE)","1694":"Slippers came on time and this my third time purchasing these slipper! My family loves them and I bought a few for my family members! Would recommend for others!","1695":"Easy to slip on, comfortable","1696":"Fit small. Gonna give them to my mom and size up for mine","1697":"For me, the bottom of my foot was very  comfortable.  Above the sole of my foot there was an unforgiving lack of softness.  The only way I could ld wear them without pain, was to have the fit too large-in danger of falling off.","1698":"For people with wide feet or high insteps","1699":"I am not sure about the positive comments.  These slides hurt my feet too much to be useful.  Cloud slides? How?  Has the definition of the word \"cloud\" changed recently?  I do think these slides would last a very long time as they are hard as a brick.  These slides have earned the nickname of \"prison shoes\" around here.","1700":"Love these.","1701":"I love this but if you have little taller heel than front part I will craze this.","1702":"Was not what I expected","1703":"Not what I expected","1704":"Whe these are comfortable to stand on, the material does not breath well. As the weather is getting warm, feet soles retain too much heat.They also are causing redded skin in the inner area of the strap","1705":"Bought these as a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves them, they\u2019re cute and very comfy she says , very happy with my purchase !","1706":"They fit so perfectly, I love the shape of the Sandel as well, it\u2019s super flattering I can wear them anywhere but prefer to keep the clean and for the house","1707":"Easy to slide on and off. Super comfy. Runs a little large.","1708":"I love them","1709":"Not hard at all, nice and squishy\/bouncy. Really comfortable","1710":"I have a similar pair from another brand that are extremely comfortable. Thought these would be the same but are very stiff and very large. Super disappointed because they had such good reviews.","1711":"I purchased these because I needed slippers that did not attract dog hair. I used to have fuzzy slippers but did not like how hair stuck all over them. Yes, I clean daily but ......well, dog peeps will understand.I like putting these on in the morning as they are nice and cushy.","1712":"Very cushy","1713":"Thought I could use these as house slippers but they are so bulky and ugly and they are. It as comfortable as they look. Returned.","1714":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0Me gustaron, lo \u00fanico que no puedo usarlas por mucho tiempo sin medias porque me pegan un poco y me generan una ampolla. \ud83d\ude31","1715":"I find these run a half a size too large and extra wide. Therefore I had to return them and purchase another brand of the same type of shoe","1716":"I need these in every color!","1717":"For the price I paid they are worth the money. However if you are not steady on your feet then these are not the shoes for you. Just walk around the house they are great. I don\u2019t wear them every day so far I have no other concerns.","1718":"Bought a pair for the entire family for around the house. Everyone loves them! They're very comfortable with a decent grip so no one is slipping and sliding anywhere. Happy with my purchase","1719":"This thing gets stuck on hardwood and could cause you to slip. Specially if you have an infant, DO NOT BUY THIS OR CARRY YOUR CHILD with it on.","1720":"Probably the most comfiest slippers I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s like walking on literal clouds! Every step feels like you\u2019re bouncing off the ground lol","1721":"Comfortable and soft, but not the best quality. For the price you get one from Adidas or Levis.","1722":"Comfy but Too big , wish there were smaller size available","1723":"I have white feet, and these are very tight. I donated them after wearing them twice","1724":"Got these for slide ons to walk outside and around the house.  They are perfect.  Super comfortable.","1725":"Extremely comfortable!!!","1726":"I have very flat feet and these seem to hurt the outset side of my foot. It seems to Be bulky on in that area I tried t he hair dryer method to fit them to my feet several times but it doesn\u2019t seem to mold.","1727":"I returned these because they were way too large.  Seemed soft and comfy, but were not at all pretty.  If they had fit, I would have kept them though.","1728":"I have narrow feet and these were so big!","1729":"Very comfortable for sore feet! But don't leave outside in the heat. They didn't do well.","1730":"My favorite sleepers","1731":"I bought these as a house shoe because I needed support and not just slippers. I wear a 7.5\/8 and ordered the 7.5-8.5 and was surprised that they barely fit. These are comfortable but not as soft as I was expecting. After an hour of wearing them my heel is actually sore which I was surprised about. Overall they\u2019re a fine slide but I\u2019m surprised they were such a big deal because the comfort is probably a 2\/5","1732":"I\u2019ve had a different brand of these slides that I loved, but I figured I\u2019d give this brand a try.  I wear a men\u2019s 13.  Unfortunately, these only go to a 12.5, but I figured I\u2019d give it a try.  I wore them the first day and they were a little snug but very comfortable.  I figured they\u2019d stretch out a little bit the more I wore them.  Sadly, I left them outside for 12 hours in the sun.  I went to put them on the next day and I could not get them halfway on my foot.  They shrunk down to approximately a women\u2019s 9 (my wife wears an 8).  So I just threw them away instead of going through the trouble of returning them.  Do NOT leave these in the sun, as they will drastically shrink.","1733":"Shoes are very comfortable, and are exactly as shown.","1734":"My heel slips a little to the side, a little big","1735":"Good but order for wrong size.","1736":"Feels like walking on clouds.","1737":"I love these shoes\u2026 comfortable.","1738":"There were instructions to use a blow dryer on them\u2026.WHY? It just made them way too loose\u2026they would be very comfortable if they weren\u2019t so wide. Wish there was a way to shrink them","1739":"Overly cushioned, makes slides feel unstable","1740":"These are not flattering on my feet and I feel like they make them look like clown feet (just huge). However, they are very comfortable to walk in around the house so I kept them. I\u2019m currently pregnant and I know that this will be nice to walk in later in pregnancy when I am in pain.","1741":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0Bought this for my boyfriend. He loves it. It has helped his feet alot being that he is flat footed and has heel problems. He says he feels he is walking in air.","1742":"So comfortable but are snug at first and run small. Recommend ordering a size up!","1743":"Seemed comfortable when I first put on, but after a couple of days my feet hurt.  Even though they are soft & cushy the edges curve up and that started to bother my feet.","1744":"Wonderful! Like walking on clouds and pillows. 10\/10","1745":"Had to return as these were ridiculously wide. I am a woman's size 10 (41) but since these are sized for unisex, they were way too wide at that size.  They did seem comfy though!","1746":"Actually husbands feet hurt walking on tile floors in home so these are being used as his slippers. He loves them.","1747":"So comfortable and true to size","1748":"Love these for around the house or running errands. Many people thought that they are Yeezy slides \ud83d\ude02","1749":"I bought these cause i spend too much time standing, believing they would be soft. Its like buying very tall crocs. Not comfortable at all, sadly","1750":"It\u2019s cute and squishy but it made the arches of my feet hurt because there\u2019s no support at all.","1751":"Super comfy!! My mom had me get her a pair!","1752":"Husband says they fit well and are very comfortable","1753":"The ideal slip on for casual wear.  Shoe runs small.","1754":"I bought these slides a while back and they WERE my favorite shoes. Im a teacher and my first pair were the only shoes that gave my feet and joints some relief after a long day at work. I told all my friends and family about how amazing they were and recently bought the slides in another color. However, they must have changed their manufacturer because the quality of my second pair are terrible. Unlike my first pair, these are stiff, formed weird from the way they were packaged, and just uncomfortable. My mom got herself a pair and hers came the same way. Don\u2019t bother, any good review must have been before this manufacturer switch.","1755":"They\u2019re just barely too big\u2026like not enough for anyone else to really notice.  I bought them as slippers for around the house since we have hardwood floors and they\u2019re perfect!!  Seriously feels like I\u2019m walking on clouds they\u2019re so comfy.  I make everyone try them on when they come over lol.","1756":"I cant use this at all.","1757":"I'm surprised at how comfy these slippers are! They offer a lot of extra cushioning and are helping my sore feet. They do run a bit wide, but overall I am super pleased with them and would highly recommend.","1758":"I use these slippers as house shoes. They are true to size and comfortable.","1759":"I'm pregnant and my old slippers couldn't support my achy feet anymore. These thick cushion are soft and support my extra weight so well. I can stand in the kitchen for extra hours now. Before I had to drag a stool next to the sink and stove so I can sit and cook\/clean.","1760":"I've had trouble with other sandals, they slide off. These stay on!","1761":"Good on the feet comfortable and soft great job! \ud83d\udc4d","1762":"Comfortable.","1763":"AWEsoMe saUCe!! These are the most amazing find!! If you, AT ALL, have, or deal with pain...these ARE your huckleberry!! Any pain; neck, back, hip, foot, hamstrings...ANY pain, will be reduced, I promise you!!Signed,Choked off spinal cord in L4\/5, broken pelvis ring, 4 ribs fractures  fractured sacrum, fractured clavicle...do yourself a favor \u270c\ud83d\ude0d\u270cThey run snug by maybe a half size","1764":"These are amazing. I wear them almost every day. Not heavy and extremely comfortable.","1765":"After shuffling through multiple products, this one fits and feels the best","1766":"Absolutely in love, will be buying more in other colors!","1767":"N\/A","1768":"These are perfect for house slides!  Very soft and comfortable for me.","1769":"Good support and cushion","1770":"Unlike traditional slippers, these don\u2019t get flattened out after a few uses. These are supportive and comfortable, and I don\u2019t think I can go back to any other kind!","1771":"Received these, they're super comfy! I thought they came in smaller, but when I slid my foot in I realized that it looks small because the sides are curved to almost hug your feet. Also relatively easy to clean, but let it hang dry for a bit on account of hte holes.","1772":"Muy c\u00f3modas para usarlas durante el d\u00eda. Se siente estar caminando sobre nubes. Muy recomendadas.","1773":"I wasn\u2019t sure about getting these because they look like hard plastic to me in the pics. I\u2019m glad I did, they are comfortable, and I wear them when I get home from work. I have plantar fasciitis right now, and these cushion my heel very well.","1774":"Because I needed them","1775":"Not a fan","1776":"Very comfortable","1777":"Felt very cushy and bouncy, but were too big. As I walked they kept sliding off my feet. Returning.","1778":"These shoes literally saved my pregnant and swollen feet. They take all the weight and pressure off your feet, legs, and back and actually allow me to stand to make dinner\/ walk around the house. Highly recommend even if not pregnant. Can't recommend these enough.","1779":"I bought two pairs for my kids who swim competitively and they are comfortable, easy to clean and dries quickly.","1780":"These are so comfy!!!","1781":"These are super soft but are wide fitting. After you wear them for a few weeks they change shape and rub blisters on your big toe","1782":"Pass. I wore these a lot and really wanted them to work cause they are cute. I wore them mostly around the house and yard or to the beach. They hurt my feet. Like cramping in the arches. The size doesn't account for the inner area so if you are true to size your heel will land on the raised part. The last straw was spraining my ankle. Luckily it wasn't broken and we threw the shoes away. Didn't want to donate them and risk issues for someone else.","1783":"No good! Smaller, a 8 is like a 6. Don\u2019t buy.","1784":"Super comfortable foam house slippers.","1785":"Best for the price and comfortable..good cushion but firm","1786":"SO AMAZING. these are the best pool slides\/everyday easy little sandals. they\u2019re a bit squeaky when you walk lol but it\u2019s fine. i feel like i\u2019m walking on a cloud. i am soooo picky about shoes but these are just amazing and so soft and squishy. so worth the money it\u2019s a steal","1787":"Too clunky for me, returned.","1788":"If you have skinny feet, these will be too large. Very comfy when I tried them on though.","1789":"No dislikes","1790":"They rubbed my big toes and I got blisters especially if wearing for a long time. Had to wear socks with them to prevent rubbing. Not what I expected.","1791":"Sized down but they are still super wide! Would not recommend unless you have wide feet","1792":"The strap on the left shoe was a bit longer than the one on the right and I didn't get the \"walking on a cloud\" comfort other reviewers did so I returned.  Was hopeful but it just didn't work out for me.","1793":"Great color, squishy, comfy, really cute.The size is kind of big. I have womens 7.5-8 and I think it is more of 8.5-9. That is OK since I can wear 8 or 8.5 but maybe not if you have 7.5","1794":"Wear them thrown them in the wash. So comfy","1795":"You will love them. I wear them everyday. Good and sturdy.","1796":"Yes they are roomy if you order your normal size but work just as expected. If you have hard floors these def give relief. They are well cushioned and squishy...they have given my legs relief.","1797":"The shoes are very weird feeling. Too soft to walk comfortably without breaking an ankle","1798":"Tik Tok made me buy these pillow slides and they seriously are the best.  Lightweight and gives my feet the right support around the house with hardwood floors.","1799":"I initially loved these shoes. Very comfortable and fit true to size. I planned to use these as pool\/beach shoes. First time I wore them to the pool, I stored them under my pool lounger in the shade. When I went to put them back on, they shrunk to the point that I could not even fit my foot back inside of them. They went from a womens size 9 to a childs size 4 (they now fit my 10 year old). Super disappointed and of course, this happened 2 days after the return window closed. If you plan to only wear these indoors, they\u2019re great. But if you want sandals that can actually go outside, do not buy these!","1800":"Had I known these slippers would shrink I would have ordered bigger sizes. I bought these slippers as general around the house slippers mostly to be worn outside. As I do with all my shoes and slippers, I leave them outside next to the door in a shoe rack. Within 10 days of being left on my porch they have shrank in size drastically. I bought a size 12 and now I cannot fit my foot in them at all. They were comfortable out of the box, but not worth the money... A waste..","1801":"Order size up","1802":"They are very comfortable, however they gave me blisters. I will have to wear them with socks.","1803":"Soft, comfortable and price beats the Steve maddens (which I bought before ordering these for my granddaughters) by a mile and quality is same or better.","1804":"I wore these throughout my third trimester. They\u2019re super comfy and on trend.","1805":"These are amazing and will be buying again! The size is a little smaller than expected but my feet fit exactly within the foot bed.","1806":"Man, these are like lil fun pillows for your feet. I wear them inside and outside. Never feel what\u2019s under my feet. Surprisingly warm. And gives an extra inch for height! Love em.","1807":"Too wide to be comfortable for an average to narrow foot. I gave them to someone who has wide feet.","1808":"Super comfy and easy to walk in at an affordable price","1809":"Big and clunky","1810":"We use these as indoor only shoes and they are comfy for the feet and hips","1811":"Size up.","1812":"This product was made well, but it runs very large and very wide.","1813":"I ordered my size but these shoes are very big.  The top of the shoe is very wide.","1814":"These are a harder material than I expected. I thought they would have more cushion than they do. They are also probably best for wider feet as I have a hard time keeping them on as I walk around the house. The size is right because my feet sit in the mold of the shoe but they just fit loose around. It also causes them to rub on my feet which starts to hurt after a while. Will be returning.","1815":"Light weight and fit perfect.","1816":"Would like a new size","1817":"I bought this pair for my sister, similar to a pair I bought myself from Zulily earlier. this pair is so much more comfortable, and I really like my pair. great slide for a great value","1818":"Like: They fit just right. Super comfortable.Dislike: none as of yet as i just wear them around the house. I do not take them outdoors or expose them to sunlike.Would I recommend? For sure.","1819":"Super comfortable and soft I love it you can put it with anything my only issue was that the size wasn\u2019t correct on this pair I got another pair and that one was perfect","1820":"The cushioning is good but the size was a little too small.","1821":"The pair I received was clearly worn. It had dark smudges in multiple spots and the front of the slipper was clearly chipped. While I admit the slippers themselves are comfortable I am very disappointed with the quality control.","1822":"Very comfortable. If you\u2019re a half size, round up","1823":"I wear these everyday! (I work from home) It provides the best comfort than anything I\u2019ve ever had. I love them!!","1824":"Sized wrong not only too long butter ver wide.","1825":"They were comfy when standing still but were not flexible when you walk.","1826":"It made my feet and toes peeling. So I needed not to wear slippers again for a couple of days until feet peeling hurts get treated. As well as, It doesn\u2019t have good specific details. When I wear it, it makes my heels comfortable at least. I recently bought a Crocs one, instead of wearing that. I would rather recommend you guys to buy Crocs.","1827":"De verdad es una inversi\u00f3n excelente \ud83d\udc4c termine comprando varias m\u00e1s para mi familia","1828":"The product is used on a daily basis & are comfortable & effective .","1829":"\u2026","1830":"I wear a size 7 shoe and got the size 6-7 and they\u2019re wayyyy too big which is disappointing. Not sure if it\u2019s because they\u2019re so big or just the shoe, but they\u2019re pretty silly looking","1831":"Excelente producto y muy c\u00f3modo","1832":"Going on 7 months pregnant and these are my favorites house shoes. So comfy!","1833":"I got these as a gift for my mom and she loves them! They are true to size and they are so comfy like pillows on your feet.","1834":"Good price, comfortable, cute color. These are perfect house shoes.","1835":"Son s\u00faper c\u00f3modos ! M\u00e1s a\u00fan si cargas a tu beb\u00e9 de 7 meses a todos lados. Soy talla 38 y orden\u00e9 7.5","1836":"Thought it would work- looking for something to wear when I\u2019m going to the hotel pool. It\u2019s big it\u2019s not that soft. It\u2019s a pain to return it -probably would\u2019ve kept it if it came with a mark on it.","1837":"Feels like clouds but slightly big! So If I get another pair I will try one size or half down!!","1838":"Perfect for indoor shoes. I don't think they'll last long is outdoor shoes.","1839":"Love them","1840":"I bought them for Vegas....AND I am in love with these cloud sandals! Super comfortable! I was skeptical at first, but now want them in every color.  I bought size 7\/8 and they fit perfectly!","1841":"Size down! Ordered my normal size and they are wayy too big.","1842":"I wear 7.5 and got the 7.5\/8.5 size and it just fits. I don't have extra room","1843":"Love these slides I can wear them all day and my feet don\u2019t hurt at then end of the night so Comfy","1844":"Very comfortable on the bottom, but the top is a little stiff.  This foot bed size is good, but super loose fit in the strap and my feel aren't thin or thick, just reg.  A little high price for the quality.","1845":"Walk softly","1846":"Most comfortable slides I own","1847":"The are like tires comfortable and feel like a lot of padded just what I need to support my pregnant weight.","1848":"I enjoy wearing mine, I just feel like my foot goes to far up but it\u2019s not terrible. I got a size 6 and that\u2019s what I usually wear and it\u2019s a good size fit","1849":"Pillow Sandle's name is very misleading. thought they'd have more cushioning to them. The plastic is awfully hard. I was thinking they'd be softer like crocs plastic. I was going to return them, but in the process of cleaning house & rearranging furniture, they got misplaced & didn't find them till after the return deadline. they were about a half size too small (my fault) & due to the hardness of the plastic, which made them too uncomfortable to wear, were the plastic softer I may have been able to wear them. But as far as the design of the sandal & the lightness of the material I had no complaints.","1850":"Fabric over the top of the shoe way to large.  The don\u2019t say on being a trip hazard","1851":"Love these slides! So so cute and comfy!!!","1852":"Love them  really comfy. I will order more.","1853":"Just too clunky and gaudy and plasticky for me. Back they go.","1854":"I love these slides for wearing around the house and for quick errands. They are so comfy and easy to clean!","1855":"Bought these shoes after seeing them all over Tik Tok and they really are great! The most comfortable shoes I own, it really is like walking on clouds! I usually wear a 8.5 and I got the 7.5-8.5 size and they fit perfectly. Highly recommend and way cheaper than the name brand!","1856":"I ordered them a bit large so I could wear socks with them, so they were big at first. One day, a couple of weeks later, I wore them with socks and could hardly get my feet into them. Then a week or so later, without socks, I tried to put my bare feet in them and they wouldn't go in!  My feet have not suddenly grown... the shoes have shrunk! What--you can't wear them outside in the sun?  I've had them about 5 weeks. Tried to contact Amazon because I've never done reviews, but they lined me up with a chat-bot and after 10 minutes of fruitlessly waiting, I'm doing my first review -- and it's a negative one.  I'm looking for a refund and I am not going to return them--it's too much work. What a ridiculous thing for shoes to do!","1857":"I like soooo much!!!","1858":"Bought a 4\/5 but fits too large, like size 6\/7","1859":"Gift","1860":"78 yrs....rare disease...PLUS DIABETIC 2...HOME CARE FOR MULTIPLE LESIONS ON BOTH FEET IN BACK HEELS....no straps in back  ....everywhere cushioned....safe to walk in....!!!NOW..  shoes will not be found in VOGUE OR ..ETC...ETC....FOR ME AN ABSOLUTE ENABLE FOR SAFE MOBILITY NO PAIN  IN FEET...","1861":"These are a great knock off to yeezys and what other celebs are wearing. They\u2019re not the most attractive slide, but they are stylish and super comfortable!","1862":"I like them but my feet are narrow so I wear them they won't stay on my feet while I walk. ..I gave them away ...when u can make them narrow let me know because I really like them thank","1863":"These fit my feet lengthwise but the arch that holds the foot was so huge that I could almost pull my ankle through it.  No top support at all.  Returned immediately.","1864":"Comfy but I fall alot in these. They make some super clumsy. Can\u2019t wear for long.","1865":"The shoes were too big and the shoes did not have enough of the \"pillow\" as promised. They do be nice tho for jus a twenny dolla bill. I have my feet in them around the house and do like!","1866":"I love them. They are son comfortable","1867":"Shoe fits to size. Very comfortable. So far no easy tears. My husband tried it on and is even getting a pair for himself","1868":"They are very puffy and soft but way too wide across the top. Great for people with wide feet.","1869":"Once you put these on you will never want to take them off. Perfect for use as slippers or as actual shower shoes makes the hard shower floor petter to stand on!","1870":"The shower slippers had obviously been worn previously.  They had stains on them and debris in the soles.  The slippers themselves were very comfortable.  I have Diabetes and have trouble with my feet especially while taking a shower.  These slippers take away all the pain.  I would have rated them 5 stars except for the fact that I paid for New slippers and received used slippers.","1871":"I usually wear 8.5-9 size sandals and shoes. This one was really small for a size 9-10.","1872":"My daughter ordered the same color and size. I can fit hers with no issue and they are comfortable.

Then they slowly began shrinking. Never left in direct heat. The house does get a bit hot, but always used indoors. Really disappointed in these sandals. Would not recommend.","1876":"Grandes para el tamano que seleccione. Son muy gruesas lo que dificulta el caminar con ellas. No las pude usar.","1877":"Love these. I got them for my whole family","1878":"They're a bit big and my foot slides out a little bit. Other than that, so very comfortable and supportive for my back issues!","1879":"I call these my marshmallow slippers. What a tremendous comfy slide. Takes a lot of pressure off the back. I have 2 pairs and got my sister and niece hooked on them as well. You won't be disappointed in them.","1880":"No support","1881":"DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE WIDE FEET.If your feed are wide, then you should not buy these. My feet have begun to develop issues from using this. It's because my toes are being crammed together, due to the limited amount of space in the slipper.They are VERY squishy though, and durable. I'm just sad because they literally are causing me more issues. Not worth it in the end. Wish I could return.","1882":"These are like walking on air!","1883":"They are super cute and comfy.","1884":"I have 3 pairs now. I need them to make boots like this for winter. I have no pain in my feet when I wear them.","1885":"They fit so nicely, and are the most comfortable shoes to wear!!! I wear them around my apartment and sometimes to class and my feet never hurt.","1886":"These are super comfy and good quality. I wear them everyday and walk around outside and they haven\u2019t worn down at all.","1887":"I wear an 8.5-9 shoe and ordered 2 sizes in this pillow soft shoe in bright yellow! Neither pair fit! Toes hung over or shoe was sloppy big. So bummed. Btw, one pair was bright yellow the other pair pastel yellow.I can not recommend this brand.","1888":"Love love love a must","1889":"These shoes are very soft which makes walking feel unnatural. They just don\u2019t offer support and cause you to compensate for it when you walk. They also make your feet sweaty. I just did not like them and I really hoped I would.","1890":"Most cozy and cool shoes!! I\u2019m obsessed!","1891":"Bought these for breast cancer awareness month since it\u2019s still warm in Georgia. Very comfortable true to size","1892":"It doesn't fit well and it's not really comfy","1893":"I love how they look and the comfort but they run small. And I purchased a 11 wished they had bigger sizes. I will keep them to be in the house.","1894":"These pillows will make you wish you never had to take them off. I have been stopped by random people asking me where I got the new \u201cyeezy slides\u201d . Loving these a lot more than I originally thought .","1895":"These are so comfortable. I\u2019m going to get one in every color.","1896":"Sandals fit fine but the strap is to loose,  so if you don't have a wide foot the sandals seems big . Length wise is good","1897":"I was so excited with this product but so disappointed, I used them only at home, never go out or shower with them and they already ripped . I wish the seller can contact me and send another pair or return my money because I bought another pair for my husband thinking they are good but only one month it\u2019s not fair.","1898":"I usually wear size 9\/10 and that is the one I ordered.

Daughter","1899":"It\u2019s okay for comfort but too big","1900":"Can not walk in these a long time. uncomfortable to me","1901":"I ordered some pink ones and they were a tad too small so I gave them to my daughter who loves them. Ordered a second pair in a bigger size and was sent a size even smaller. AND one was bigger then the other. Sending the second pair back and not risking it again. I\u2019ll go try somewhere  in person to buy. Just a bummer cause I really like the red!","1902":"Best soft shoes EVER! Best Buy in years!!! Love these!","1903":"These are so hard!  They rubbed blisters on the sides of my feet.  The bottoms are soft enough but the sides are so hard it ruins them.  I\u2019m sure there are other brands that are better.  Don\u2019t waste your money.","1904":"Most comfortable slip ons I've ever owned.","1905":"These fit well for about a month, and then I left them in my car for about 6 hours. They shrunk to the point I cannot even get my feet into them. Absolutely would not recommend this product.","1906":"Me encantan s\u00faper c\u00f3modas","1907":"I do not have narrow or wide feet, the slip in hurt when I walked for any period of time.  I thought there would be more arch support","1908":"Bought them for my wife to possibly relieve foot and knee discomfort...which she believed was being caused by the slippers she wore. After wearing these for two or three weeks, I haven't heard the complaints I usually hear...only praise for how comfortable they are!","1909":"I had high hopes for these when reading the reviews and the fact that they are called \u201cPILLOW SLIDES\u201d. These are a complete waste of money, feels like I\u2019m walking on hard rubber, and definitely not cute at all. All in all, YIKES. Don\u2019t waste your money.","1910":"Have huge crack in these after only wearing them twice.. Not as durable as others. Wont purchase this brand again","1911":"I ordered these in black and pink. The black pair fit perfectly, but the pink are at least one size too small. As shown in the photos, the size is the same, 39-40. I really want the pink, but not sure which size to order.","1912":"I ordered black in the 7-8 size.  They are so small my heel hangs over the back..Sending back will try another size larger..So disappointing.","1913":"Besides the fact that these shoes look like jail house shoes, they are literally the most comfortable shoes I\u2019ve ever put on my feet!","1914":"They feel like you\u2019re stepping on a cloud. Very comfortable! They were worth the money I spent. Very sturdy!","1915":"I bought these from the same company as the tan ones and they are completely different in softness and material. These are rough and the others were so soft. I\u2019m so disappointed that the quality is not consistent among colors.","1916":"Amazing","1917":"I love these cushy bouncy shoes! I will be sizing down next time. They run a little wide but I don't mind because they stay on my feet!","1918":"I had ordered these exact shoes from this seller and they were great so I ordered in another color, same size and they were too small. Weird.","1919":"Cute and very comfy, will buy again","1920":"This product does not seem to have any concept of correct sizing. I bought a 9-10. Which was more like a 12 it was huge and returned.  I bought a 7-8 thinking that might work. It did not and that one was returned.","1921":"I wish they have shoes too","1922":"I returned this item as they were not as soft as the tan color ones. This was a month ago. As of today I have not received my credit.","1923":"These are extremely comfortable! They\u2019re lightweight and have that little bounce that takes the weight off your feet","1924":"Not as soft as I thought.  One shoe is looser Around the top than the other.  Not so comfortable.","1925":"The color is not green enough, more like creamy coffee with hint of olive green. Biggest problem\u2026straps are so large and loose that I cannot wear them, even with socks. Gave to my son who loves them. I can\u2019t buy this brand again because of the very wide & loose fit. The footprint is correct.","1926":"Comfortable enough for the brief time I needed them, but make my feet stinky.","1927":"Super comfy","1928":"I ordered a size 10 and it doesn\u2019t fit I know that it should equal to a man\u2019s 8.5 it\u2019s just not true to size.","1929":"These are very comfortable. I wore them daily to school and my feet were not sore at the end of the day. However, I wore them to the beach and the actually shrunk in the sun\/heat. This also happened to others as well. :(5 stars in all areas except overall due to the shrinking.","1930":"These were so big around my foot. There was no compression to keep my foot in.

I had hard time on my left feet for some reason, I guess it needed little adjusting to my feet.  However, after just few days of use, they have shrunk so much that I can't even put my feet on.  I would suggest go for a better shoe\/sandal and save your money.","1935":"These were great for the first two days, however I left them outside on my deck, and they shrunk to the point where I can't even get them on my feet. Such a waste of money.","1936":"Love these! They are super comfy.

Regret that I made this purchase. Bad quality, waste of money.","1943":"good product for shower or slippery surface.  But on smooth wood floor is too sticky and that can trip you.  I only use outside.","1944":"These slides were sooo so comfy, BUT the sandal part going over your foot was TIGHT. I have plantar facetious, which is why I got these, but it put pressure where pressure was not wanted :( I was so sad... they were soooo comfy otherwise. ALSO, order a size UP! I usually wear a 10 and got the 10.5\/11.5. MY FOOT FIT PERFECTLY! Not too large, not too small. The slides should have been way too big","1945":"The Bronax shoe is low quality. Order red - arrived red but with a light pink vertical line down right shoe and miss shaped toe box. Slides appeared to been worn as soles are dirty. The shoe is cushy however definitely runs small. I will confirm country of origin (China) before I purchase anything else from Amazon.","1946":"Sure wish I was still in the window to return these.  They shrunk!!!  Not sure how that happened, but bought these for my grandchild and they were a little big and now they are too short and tight across the instep.  Not sure if it's the brand or not.

I\u2019m going to try the next size down with the hope they might be narrower. Both of my feet almost could fit in the pair I got. Very disappointed","1956":"The length was perfect but was too loose around the top of my foot since it is narrow.I didn't even try to walk in it.  Too old to fall because of a loose shoe.This shoe needs to be adjustable like other slides.  Then I would buy in a Skinny MinuteJust Sayin'!","1957":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0Fits perfect! Feels amazing. Super comfy. I love it.","1958":"Very wide and made my feet look even larger.  Not comfortable because they are wide. Bought a pair from target which are much nicer and more comfortable","1959":"Left them out on the back deck for one day and they went from fitting my men's size 12 feet (albeit snugly) to a comfortable fit for someone who ordinarily wears a 7 in men's sizes. If someone made slides out of Shrinky-Dink material, these would be them!","1960":"My wife loves it","1961":"These shoes are way too big and I even sized down a full size. Extremely disappointed. I have more narrow feet and the top strap doesn\u2019t even touch my foot when standing up.","1962":"Very soft and comfortable!!!","1963":"Perfect for showers at the gym","1964":"I bought 3 pair of these shoes and i used them at the beach this summer and the shoes shrunk to the point i couldnt wear them. very dissapointed in this feature because they were very comfortable and now i have no use for them.  what a waste of money","1965":"I ordered my size according to the chart and they are huge. The length seems ok but they are like Fred Flintstone wide. And I have wide feet.","1966":"Very comfy just they run small. You need to size up","1967":"","1968":"Soles are very slick!  Hard to keep on!","1969":"I'm a solid size 9. These are the 9\/10 which I went with because many reviewers said they run small but this is huge. The sizing must be very inconsistent.","1970":"Gave these to my husband and son for Father's Day.  They have used them for 2 weeks on and off.  Both pairs have shrunk to the point that our young grandchild can wear them.  Since I ordered them in May for Father's Day, I can't return them.  What a horrible waste of money!!!","1971":"They're comfortable but the top is prone to ripping","1972":"This is the 1st pair I purchased from this company. They\u2019re not very soft and bouncy. They\u2019re a bit hard. I bought a pair from another company and they were bouncy and nice at first but then became hard. It\u2019s hit or miss","1973":"These are literally the comfiest shoes I\u2019ve ever owned. Worth the money!

Hudge","1983":"They run small","1984":"The sandals shrink severely after I put them outside in the patio for 1 day so it does not fit anymore. Not sure about the reason, but apparently the quality is not good.","1985":"They are kinda small and too squishy for my liking. The material also rubs and causes blisters on my feet just walking around the house. Fine with socks, but these should be no more than $5.","1986":"It's like walking on clouds these are the best slippers I've ever worn so worth the money","1987":"The extreme cushion effect caused my joints to ache after some use and caused pain in my feet from day 1. Gave away after some hours of use. Find a different brand, I\u2019ve used others without this issue.","1988":"I bought these for my mom I\u2019m a size 10 and they fit perfectly. I bought a pair for myself in a size 11 and the 11 is smaller than the 10. My foot is hanging off the back. Not accurate sizing. Very disappointed. Wouldn\u2019t buy again.","1989":"After having them for 5 days they shrunk in the sun while I was at the beach. So much so that I can\u2019t even slide my foot into the shoe.

But over all so comfortable. I\u2019m definitely getting a second pair","1995":"I am regularly a size 7.5. I ordered a size womens 7.5-8.5. They were so soft, but way too big. about 1.5 inches too long, and very loose over the top of my foot so they wouldn\u2019t stay on for one step. So I sent them back, and got a size 6-7. Well it arrived, and it\u2019s the exact same size as the 7.5-8.5s. And there isn\u2019t even a size marking on the shoe. I really want to have these, they are so soft. But you\u2019d have to be really lucky to happen to get the right size. Oh well. Returning them again.","1996":"So bummed bought my true size and it\u2019s too small. Comfy but too small :(","1997":"Very comfortable.","1998":"I got these because I love slides. These would've been perfect for the pool... not. They were so uncomfortable, felt like I was leaning and they were tight on my feet. I tried wetting them and wearing them more and nothing changed. It was a waste of money for me. I also bought them a size bigger to make sure they fit and it didnt","1999":"Sizing off , color described as taupe , actually a light cream .

I tried to rinse off but it was too late. They are now so small that they won't fit my feet. I try to squish my feet in them and they hurt. Now I am stuck with these garbage shoes that I thought would be great for by the pool. So now, they get a bad review!","2005":"Great","2006":"The slides are incredibly comfortable! I chose the color red which makes them extra fun to wear. I wish they were just a tiny bit tighter across the band, but it\u2019s not a big deal.","2007":"I\u2019d definitely buy it again","2008":"One shoe is bigger than the other shoe even though they are both marked the same size.","2009":"They shrank almost two sizes while being outside.

I ended up returning them as they are absolutely not what I expected but every feet can be different and it may work for you. I would say they have good support and as you step on it and they are soft, but not for everybody.","2012":"I decided to get these for a trip and I\u2019m so sad! I ordered half a size larger than what I normally wear (10 in women) and they are too small! My toes hang off the front or my heel hangs off the back. I wanted to order a size up but the next size isn\u2019t available in the pink color.","2013":"I previously order a pair of these shoes in the color white, size 9-10. I normally wear between 8.5-9 in womens shoes. They fit perfectly and are SO comfy. I\u2019ve been wearing them since I got them. Well, since I love them so much, I ordered another pair in black, size 9-10 (same size as the white). Sadly, they are too big and they didn\u2019t seem as good quality as the white ones I previously ordered and loved. Maybe it\u2019s a defective pair?","2014":"I thought because they had more reviews, these would be the best but they are not. They are not bad but the pillow slides are soooo much comfier IMO.","2015":"Comfiest slide-ons ever! More comfortable than crocs. My boyfriend was wearing mine so much that I had to buy him a pair as well.","2016":"Very comfortable shoes especially if you have bad knees!","2017":"Returning.

As in wide and the shoe itself just is huge. Returned cause they were ugly","2023":"I have bad ankles and it was suggested that they were great for bad ankles. Between that, the width and the cross strap being too high for my foot I couldn\u2019t get out of them fast enough. Btw I have a normal size 8 foot.","2024":"Too large had to return..","2025":"Look really big on your feet and not as soft as I was expecting.","2026":"These are sized very large. I\u2019m a 6 and these were gigantic on me. Looked huge too. Nice color.","2027":"I was very excited when I received the slides. They were a perfect fit and seemed to have good support. I wore them once. Left the slides poolside when I went for a swim. They shrank from the sun and I couldn\u2019t wear them. Had towalk barefoot.","2028":"Like walking on a cloud","2029":"fits way too big and easy to trip on yourself","2030":"The slippers were very comfortable and seemed durable, however one slipper was about 2 sizes too small","2031":"Way to small for size recommended.I ordered my size and it was 2 sized to small and a little to tight.","2032":"I love these shoes","2033":"These are not nearly as soft as other slides of the same style - if you are looking for that quality - look elsewhere!","2034":"Very soft","2035":"They were soft and the one that fit was comfortable","2036":"Super comfortable like walking on clouds","2037":"love these- very comfortable - standard fit -","2038":"Live color and very cushioned but it was so wide, I could get my entire hand in under the strap in addition to my foot. I wear a 7 1\/2 woman\u2019s (offer a wide width) can\u2019t imagine who could fill this shoe.","2039":"I\u2019ve ordered several pairs of shoes online - I have a pretty average sized foot. The ones I ordered were my size - and the size suggested by Amazon and they are small enough I can\u2019t wear them.","2040":"I bought this cloud slipper 15 days ago and it's already starting to tear. It is very comfortable but not durable at all","2041":"Came completely folded\/smushed. Cant get them to form back - not that I would want them to. I purchased a 9-10 as I wear 9\/9.5 and these are 2 sizes too big. Might try in a smaller size but if they are completely ruined again it would be a waste of money and time","2042":"LOVE these!!!! So comfy, I\u2019m ordering a second pair! Fits true to size","2043":"Left my shoes in the sun one afternoon and they shrank down 5 sizes. Now they won\u2019t even fit my 8 year old!","2044":"These were just like any other regular slide out in the market. Stiff and not pillow like at all. Not squishy and didn\u2019t give me foot or ankle relief as claimed. I\u2019m returning and will be looking for a more authentic pair.","2045":"I loved these shoes and wore them everyday. Yesterday I wore them to the beach and they shrunk multiple sizes being in the sun. Disappointing.","2046":"super comfortable, correct size. feels great. wife loves them.","2047":"Not Happy, They do not fit me. I'd like to return.","2048":"So disappointed in these. I got the smallest size and they still didn't fit me, and even tried the heating method they suggested. It wouldn't shrink. The base of the shoe ultimately doesn't fit a size 5 women's. Also I was expecting it to have a little give but it's hard. Why do people call this a cloud??","2049":"If your sensitive to way things feel this is not the shoe for you!! I was worried about that when I ordered it and I was right and thats why I sent it back.  But if your not sensitive to that then just get 1\/2 up then you normally would and you'll have a good slip on shoe!","2050":"they are comfortable and dry quickly. Would recommend.","2051":"My feet had blisters from wearing these for just one day!!!  I had to return these!!","2052":"These should be called clown shoes.

They don\u2019t even fit anymore, they\u2019re SO small now.","2058":"I thought these slip ins were comfy but they were pretty big above the top of my foot.

They\u2019re kind of bulky","2061":"I loved them but once they got wet when I was outdoors the next day they no longer fit. They shrunk from the water and then drying.","2062":"You won\u2019t slip - from shoe to floor. I feel safe in that regard. But foot on shoe - so slippery - I don\u2019t feel safe walking around in them. Finally, the main reason I bought them - softness. Not even close. They\u2019re rock hard. Complete disappointment.","2063":"Bad","2064":"These sandals stretch larger and larger as you continue to wear them. They get sticky and gross if you leave them out in the sun!","2065":"Bummer they didn\u2019t hold up. I have a concrete floor and also wore them outside to the mailbox and such. I\u2019ve worn these a few weeks and the right one cracked.","2066":"Ridiculous how wide they are. I got a size smaller than usual and they fall off my feet! They don\u2019t even touch the top of my foot when it\u2019s in the shoe. the band is way too big and doesn\u2019t fit according to shoe size!","2067":"I am soooo disappointed in these shoes. I was looking forward to them and having some comfort.  Very rough on feet and not comfortable at all! Don't waste your money! I should have shopped better and looked around. Very disappointed","2068":"I ordered womens size 6. They came more like size 10","2069":"DO NOT leave these in the sun, even for a little bit\u2026.I left my shoes right outside the front door for a few hours and the shrunk and warped dramatically. Never have I ever experienced anything like this with a shoe but the tops warped and the shoes shrunk to an unwearable point, probably an entire shoe size. Very uncomfortable and a complete waste of money. This is beyond bizarre and such a complete disappointment.","2070":"The size if this product was WAY OFF. I ordered a Womens size 8. It is like 2 sizes too small.I don\u2019t trust ever ordering anything from these people! Thank you for tipping me off!","2071":"These shoes are ENORMOUS like shockingly large haha and they weren\u2019t that much bigger than my normal shoe size they just look like cartoon big on my feet.

This has ABSOLUTELY ZERO ARCH SUPPORT!","2085":"They don\u2019t keep your feet cool.","2086":"This brand cloud slides run large. I sized down, normally 8.5 to 9, and bought 8.

Not true to size at all!!!  Don\u2019t buy these shoes!!!","2105":"Noticed that they shrunk several sizes if left outside in the sun. Now they don't fit.","2106":"I bought these because i had purchase ones from tjmaxx. Well let me say, these are not the same at all.! To begin with these run bigger than the tjmaxx ones.

And my womens size 8 fit into a mens size 9.5","2113":"casual wearing","2114":"Too cumbersome and sloppy fitting. Turned my ankle walking in them!","2115":"More comfort, cushion inside the shoe, is needed to protect the skin on your toes that rub against inside plastic. Even with a comfortable fit, the plastic causes irritation.","2116":"Got it for my wife and she is a size 7 and has skinny feet so the strap that runs across is too big. Her feet just slips right through. Doesn\u2019t fit well.","2117":"Way too big and not supportive at all. It\u2019s like wearing pool noodles to walk around in. Awful.","2118":"These are great slides and very comfortable I\u2019m really happy with them!","2119":"I wear a size 6 and ordered the size recommended.  They seemed more like a size 8.  These are the clunkiest, clumsiest clown-like shoes I have ever tried to wear.  I opted to return them rather than break my neck.  I really didn't feel like they were any more comfortable than a good pair of tennis shoes or slip-ons.  And trying to walk in them is a joke.","2120":"I bought into the hype, but these suck compared to other foam slippers. The only ones I've found supportive for me are the OOFOS brand. These BRONAX ones feel super cheap in comparison.","2121":"This particular brand was too short. I wear a 12 women and can often fit 11 \/ 11.5 slides. Ordered the 12 and they fit like a regular 11 yet were too wide at the front. Returning","2122":"I have very big and wide feet 40W.  This slipper is so soft and comfortable but my foot slid through the front of toe.  SO wide.  Had zero support.  Like walking on mini mattresses that don\u2019t stay on your feet. Had to return.

It was as if it were rwo completely different sizes.","2124":"Less than a month old they have torn almost all  across. Not worth the money.","2125":"Size down because in a month's time it stretches out","2126":"How do you manage to stain black shoes?\u2026With white. Somehow when I received these it looked like someone spilled white or light pink nail polish on them in a couple spots (see pic). I put in a return request immediately after opening and seeing the stains.I\u2019m a size 7 and bought the suggested size. They were big. I recommend sizing down.","2127":"Length was perfect but huge width!","2128":"Dirty, used, not as described.

Don\u2019t do it.","2138":"I am usually around a 12.5 size for almost any shoe I wear. When I tried these for the first time, it did not go well. I tried a few more times, but I couldnt wear them anymore. I would go a size up but 12.5 is the max size they do for most of these sandals. Be mindful and go a size up on your size for this brand.","2139":"Est\u00e1s apargatas son m\u00e1s falsas qu\u00e9 mi t\u00eda jugando con la mona lisa al gin gin","2140":"I did not like that they shrink.","2141":"Not comfortable, rigid and rough texture. Disappointed.","2142":"The product appears well constructed however they run very large. Too big for my feet. Unfortunately I had to send them back.","2143":"too big","2144":"Returning these. My daughter has the same exact sandal and I loved them. Her and I wear the same size so that\u2019s what I ordered but when I received them they were about a size bigger and do not fit. I read multiple reviews claiming this happened to them but didn\u2019t think much of it and bought them anyway. Should\u2019ve paid attention to the reviews.","2145":"Super supportive but left them in my car for a weekend and when I came back they were assymetrically shrunk and I cannot wear them any longer.","2146":"These are very comfortable but that comfort comes at a price.  They are so tall that the excessive height causes me to stumble and trip constantly.  Therefore, I cannot wear them.","2147":"I was excited to get these. I wish the sizing wasn't so weird. I would definitely go up a size!","2148":"Please help me out they rub feet raw","2149":"Hard as rock 3\/4 times too big. Nothing like what you think you\u2019re getting.","2150":"These are basically plastic! Not comfortable at all. I wore them for 10 min and the hard plastic gave me blisters. Very disappointed","2151":"Ordered Womens 9-10 and the ones I received are at least an 11 and wide for mens fit. Won't order again.","2152":"way too small. order a size up for SURE","2153":"Won\u2019t buy again","2154":"Way too big ! It says women 6-7 . I can wear ether 6 or 6 1\/2 , it didn't offer half size which is ok but this shoes way too big on me!I look a like I'm wearing someone else's borrowed shoes !Hate it !","2155":"Size is larger and not comfortable cause foot pain","2156":"Is you don't mind them looking like a rubber brick under your foot and comfort is all you need, then this shoes for you!","2157":"Awful item. Returning. I gave them away. To much trouble to send back. Donated","2158":"They are super cushioned and soft but WAY too wide.","2159":"After wearing these for good minutes, my feet started hurting and started having leg pain.  Maybe not meant for walking around the house in.  A podiatrist definitely did not have their say in these.","2160":"They\u2019re cute, comfortable and as expected other than the fact they they run 2 full sizes small.","2161":"The left shoe has a texture spot that is pointed and hurts the foot.","2162":"Liked softness, didn\u2019t like that they don\u2019t stay straight on your feet!","2163":"A 10.5 womens fits my husbands size 13 (mens) foot!","2164":"I got these after seeing so many on Tik Toks. Well, they run narrow!!! Very narrow! Perfect if you have skinny feet. I returned them and wasn\u2019t sure a larger size would help. Too bad, so cute! I\u2019m on a shirt buying binge right now, so follow me and check out my recent reviews!","2165":"The slippers are soft, but uncomfortable and there\u2019s no support. The right size and too big at the same time. It\u2019s weird. These are meant to wear with thick socks, maybe? Very unattractive for several reasons.","2166":"While these fit in length they packaged one shoe inside the other so the top part is stretched out, or maybe they are just made big across the top. Either way returned. Not with slipping out of them and hurting myself.","2167":"Left them out in the sun to dry. They shrunk so bad they don\u2019t fit lol","2168":"Big bulky looked terrible","2169":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0House slippers busted open after a few months. Return\/exchange window closed recently. -of course.","2170":"While these look cute in the photo, you miss the lack of care with production. Many irregularities with quality and extremely wide. When I tried mine on with socks they were still too wide","2171":"not comfortable at all, avoid these.","2172":"They felt like they were going to come off all the time.","2173":"Too big not sized correctly as indicated","2174":"To big causing toes to overhang","2175":"Very comfortable but extremely small. I ordered a size up from my normal and they were still too small.","2176":"After reading several reviews I purchased them and now I\u2019m returning them big bulky not comfortable","2177":"I wanted these shoes so badly but they were way too big. I wear a 6 B and normally have no problem with shoes being too wide. The shoe bed fit perfectly and was so comfortable but the band (strap) was so wide that I could fit both my foot and all four fingers inside! I even tried it with two pairs of thick wool socks. Maybe the pair I got were defective as I can\u2019t imagine the foot that these monsters would fit\u2026maybe the Bride of Frankenstein?","2178":"Thought they were going to be soft and like walking on clouds\u2026\u2026.NOT!!!","2179":"These were so hideous, I sent them back","2180":"Returned","2181":"I got blisters on my big toes because of the rigged lines on this slipper which is not indicated on items description. I'm not happy with my purchase.","2182":"I bought the Black ones in NY my regular size. They were so big I tripped and nearly killed myself. In Florida I purchased two size smaller and as you can see they fit perfectly. Falsely advertise as true to size.","2183":"Hard, uncomfortable. Do not recommend this brand.","2184":"Not for me","2185":"The shoes were not true to size and very uncomfortable, not soft at all. I wish I never would have ordered them.","2186":"It is much too large for the medium size I ordered.  Will return it","2187":"Just after few minutes of walking in them around the house i start feeling pain in the entire foot. And it happens each time, i do not recommend","2188":"I liked the softness but was too big for my narrow feet.","2189":"Too large, Too hard, Quality not there...J.Shivers","2190":"I\u2019m not sure how these have good reviews. They hurt. They make my feet sweat a lot. I had to throw them out.","2191":"The range in the size I ordered is too broad. The shoe flopped on my feet. The width was too wide.","2192":"I ordered a pair in black and the left and right sandal came in two completely different sizes. Had to return. Afraid to order again because I am worried I will run into the same issue. I saw lots of other reviews saying the same thing.","2193":"These slip is were very comfortable but too wide for me.","2194":"I returned these. The women\u2019s size 8 was huge. They were more like a man\u2019s sandal.","2195":"It doesn\u2019t stay on your foot. Worst slippers ever.","2196":"Too big","2197":"Where to start\u2026 I only wore these for 10 minutes and already left a sore on my foot. These slide off when you walk and they are very uncomfortable. Also, they\u2019re dangerous! I almost tripped a few times! Returning these!","2198":"Would not recommend","2199":"Nothing about this product is as advertised. Why would someone pay this much for a cheap product that is not comfortable","2200":"Very uncomfortable,","2201":"I was expecting a better feel & good material but it was cheap plastic so I ended up returning it.","2202":"Save your money and time. Sent back","2203":"I wanted to love these but after 2 different sizes, I give up. The 9s were huge. The 8s were the correct length but way too big around the strap. Bummer!","2204":"Great and comfortable until we took them to the beach and the heat shrunk  them. They don\u2019t feet anymore and can\u2019t return them.","2205":"Just awful","2206":"Without socks these slippers literally rubbed my feet raw. Like a rug burn on your toes. Had to immediately order something different. However they comfort isn\u2019t bad if you have socks on to cover your feet. Without socks, DO NOT wear","2207":"I sized down and my boyfriend could fit them... he is 4 sizes larger than me in shoes. RETURNING","2208":"Cannot use these shoes","2209":"Too wide","2210":"They are cheap for a reason. Uncomfortable with no support.","2211":"Very disappointed with fit. Product was not true to size.Way to big!Unfortunately had to return and will not be ordering.","2212":"I disliked this item completly ,bulky,hard to walk in ,so any cushion effects were lost on me.","2213":"These would not stay on my feet. The way the shoe is made it kept pushing my feet out of it so I couldn\u2019t walk in them at all. Had to return them.","2214":"Not comfortable","2215":"I didn't have option to do a return or I would have. They are way too big.","2216":"they were to wide, but seemed good quality, and cute.","2217":"There is nothing soft about these! I have the leopard printed ones that are amazing, the black ones are horrible!","2218":"The slides definitely runs a little bigger not true to size so I would size down.","2219":"Very stiff. Not recommended for people with painful foot condition.","2220":"Lovely color. Ordered regular size but foot slipped forward and I felt like I was wearing clown shoes","2221":"Item returned","2222":"I purchased these in hopes that they would provide a cushion type comfy feel and yet they were the total opposite. They were not cushioned as one would think by the way they look and they are extremely oversized. They are not flattering at all.","2223":"Super comfy but they broke within month of using.","2224":"So, everyone has these slippers thanks to tik tok. I bought it and it hurt my foot so much. They have these rigged lines Inside the slippers and that rubbed against my skin and I had a blister on my big toe. Had to return it. Not for me.","2225":"feels like your foot is unable to get firm support anywhere, kinda feels like your off balance","2226":"From time to time I\u2019ve had hives from latex. These gave me a reaction. Add to that if your foot is narrow they may slip out.","2227":"got the pink ones. didn't even bother unwrapping them. they're boats that will never fit my feet and will be sent back. i should have listened to the review pointing out their inconsistent sizing","2228":"I ordered a women's 9-10 and I couldn't even get my foot into the slip on.  The labeling was poor so I don't know what size they sent. Would not recommend this product via the mail.","2229":"Nothing it was a waste of money","2230":"I bought these slides to wear at the pool or beach.  They are comfortable as long as you have DRY feet. I got out of the pool, slipped them on and nearly broke my ankle in them. Wet bare feet make it impossible to walk, sliding all over inside rubber pillow slippers, making for an accident waiting to happen. Beware!","2231":"Two different sized shoes came. Misses the return window so I can't return them. Disapo","2232":"The sole on these slides nice nd thick but the footbed was still soft & cushiony.  However, I need a little more width across the front.  I have small bunion on right foot & it was rubbing up against the inside of the slide.  Also, there was a lot of room between the top of the slipper and the top of my foot.  I really wanted to keep but the right side was not comfortable for me.  However, I\u2019d still recommend","2233":"I ordered an 11 and they didn\u2019t fit my feet they were way too small.","2234":"Really ugly","2235":"Uncomfortable and I could use these.  I will give them to Goodwill.  Bummer.","2236":"The \u201cwhite\u201d is an off gray, dirty looking color","2237":"I ordered 7.5 - 8.5 since I'm 7.5 in shoe size --- too small. I should have listened to reviews. Should have ordered next size up.","2238":"supposed to be comfortable but my feet hurt when I use them and gave me blistersso they went to the back of the closet","2239":"Too frumpy looking.  Horrible fit.  Ugly.","2240":"I don't understand. I have bought 4 pairs of these slides and they all are a different in the way they feel.","2241":"They do remind me of the moon shoes b  as close in the day. Bulky, not enough arch support. They are comfy at first but, caused me discomfort after 30 minutes. Just not for me. Using them as a slipper.","2242":"cheap looking","2243":"I disliked the ridges inside on by the toes. Should be smooth. If I wear socks it\u2019s OK","2244":"Shoes was clunky and uncomfortable, makes you feel like you are about to fall over. And I might add they run small and narrow","2245":"RUNS TOO big and came damaged","2246":"The product did not come as advertised. The quality is not good. I bought so I could compare it to another brand that had promised the same quality. These ones do not match the price point at all.","2247":"Nothing like the ones my sister ordered from a diff company!! Cheep looking compared to hers. I ordered off another sight for less $ and they actually hold your feet in!! These had a pink tint to the tan color too:(","2248":"These are gigantic!!! Ridiculous","2249":"they\u2019re not comfortable at all and very ugly. if ur looking for cute slippers don\u2019t get it.if u need shower shoes then these would b good for that.","2250":"Too small","2251":"The strap on top was too large and would not stay on when walking.","2252":"Not reliable size so you slip around in your sliders.. so much so I twisted my ankle. Props to the company and Amazon.. I could have returned them but ran out of time so that\u2019s my fault","2253":"It is too soft and does not keep foot properly supported. Causes calf muscle pain","2254":"The size 9-10 fit me better than 7.5-8.5, but they are way less pillowy and soft than the smaller size, so I\u2019ll be returning.","2255":"Not at all what described. They are very clumsy to wear. Seller. Are it difficult to return so I\u2019m just keeping them","2256":"My toes & soles got calluses after a month.  Slippers are comfortable, I didn\u2019t realize calluses are forming slowly.  Return window is closed.","2257":"Aweful","2258":"I\u2019ve been wearing around my house trying to break them in and they are one of the most uncomfortable pair of shoes I\u2019ve ever owned.","2259":"I want to return because it is too big for me.Please send me how to return it.e","2260":"I didn\u2019t know what to expect from these; would they feel like Yeezys, or perhaps my old Adidas \u201cmassaging\u201d flip-flops from high school? Nope. Neither.At first i thought they were a bit small, but once  I followed the instructions and molded them to my feet using the socks\/blowdryer technique, I have cast aside my Ugg slippers (of which I have been wearing some form or another for the past 12 years) for these bad girls, and I have not looked back.Also, I got them in white which can tend to get a little dingy looking from time to time but no matter, I just spray with some KaBoom cleaner and let sit for 5 minutes, rinse and they are like new (and disinfected). (A Mr. Clean Magic Eraser works too, but who wants to scrub?)I even bought a pair for my husband who has what I lovingly call \u201cFranken-feet.\u201d  After I did the molding technique for him and he wore them a bit with socks (and then without) to give them some extra stretch, he is also now a BROMAX Bro.**I was not compensated by BROMAX in any way for writing this review but, like, I wouldn\u2019t say no if they offered, you know? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffb JK?","2261":"On the order it said 7-7.5 for women and I got 9","2262":"Not true to size too large and too wide","2263":"I didn\u2019t like how it was packaged it dented my slippers.","2264":"I have neuropathy in both feet so finding a slider or any type of shoe is very difficult. I\u2019ve tried every brand out there in sandles, sneakers and shoes. I read the reviews on theses and at first I was skeptical, because there\u2019s good and bad. Not sure how anyone can say anything bad about theses. HANDS DOWN THESES ARE THE BEST, Soft and comfortable. It\u2019s like walking on a sponge. I can\u2019t say clouds because I\u2019ve never walked on them lol. But put a few sponges together and you have theses. I haven\u2019t taken them off. I will be ordering more colors. I normally wear a 9 but my foot is very thin so I got size 71\/2-81\/2 and they fit perfectly. Don\u2019t want on getting them run lol because now I can","2265":"I like everything except my feet feel sweaty after wearing all day.","2266":"Comfy but the top is a little flimsy and they run at least a full size big","2267":"Very comfortible but the vendor kept sending the wrong sizes.","2268":"The interior of the shoe was not comfortable. Too rough feeling and rubbed my feet raw.","2269":"I loved these slides and wore them daily around the house. I left them outside for 24 hours and today they have shrunk! They no longer fit. It\u2019s as if they shrunk 2 sizes in the sun. It didn\u2019t rain, just the 95* NY heat wave. I cannot get my foot all the way in and my heel is hanging off the back. My son left his Addidas slides right next to mine and they are unchanged. Why did the sun shrunk my favorite slides??","2270":"I ordered the green ones + am obsessed with them! they're so incredibly comfortable. so much so, that my husband steals them from me all the time. so I decided to order him a black pair. however, the black ones that arrived are not even the same sandal, not nearly as soft, + WAY SMALLER. I ordered the black ones 2 sizes bigger than the green pair, + they ended up being even smaller than mine!! so disappointed that they're not even remotely similar :(","2271":"looks like two totally different size shoes. the left is super tight and the right is way too big.","2272":"These shoes are small snd tight not true to size add 3 sizes to your size","2273":"Good bye Crocs! And Hello big yellow flip flops!Soo comfortable! I find these are fast becoming my go-to shoes!","2274":"I guess u get what u pay for.","2275":"Not true to size","2276":"I ordered white and they are light grey color is so off","2277":"Love the color and comfort","2278":"I order ed a womans size 8. They fit like a mans. Way too big","2279":"The first pair was too big.  Since they don't do half sizes, I would order down. So I did that with the next pair and they fit perfectly.  However they rubbed against my big toe and irritated it.  They were so comfortable though, and would be great if you don't have a hammer toe like I did.","2280":"TOO BIG AND TOO STIFF.RETURNED IT. DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL.","2281":"they\u2019re SO comfy and exactly like I expected. They\u2019re PERFECT","2282":"I agree with what everyone has already said\u2014these are light and comfortable, cute and perfect for wearing around the house. If that\u2019s all I had to say, I wouldn\u2019t leave a review, but I have something to add: these slippers are indestructible.Long story short, I put these on top of my car while loading up some other things. You can imagine what came next from the first picture; I drove away with them still on the roof, and found them on my street an hour later with tire marks trailed across them. Naturally, I was disappointed by my own irresponsibility. How could I be so careless with something I love so much? Guilt aside, I was impressed by how well they held up! I rushed inside and got scrubbing with some laundry detergent and they cleaned up nicely.The only other thing that fell off my roof my Levi jean shorts. Review for those forthcoming.","2283":"Been seeing these for a while on the deals and best sellers, decided to give them a try. VERY comfortable shoes and they fit perfectly!  The price is right also.","2284":"Bought these for my daughter to wear in the bathroom at college. They are so comfortable, that she wears them outside now. Good, inexpensive slides.","2285":"Does not run true to size. Runs big","2286":"","2287":"Run extremely small according to size chart","2288":"Love the color, fit, and comfort of these. Will purchase more!!","2289":"Size is wrong. To big , too wide","2290":"Quedaron al size","2291":"The shoe is made a bit weird","2292":"Very solid heavy shoes, not much cushion like you would think","2293":"*I actually ordered a black pair in size 7, btw*My boyfriend ordered me these slippers bc I needed something comfy for my feet during this pregnancy. We have hard floors and they KILL my feet after just a few minutes of standing.I cannot brag about these shoes enough. They're so squishy and perfect, they make my feet stop hurting instantly. They are a LITTLE big (I'm a true size 7) but that doesn't bother me at all. My feet will swell a bit if I'm on them too long anyway hah.I don't think I've ever left a review for anything even though I order so much s* from Amazon lol. But I have been saying every day how grateful I am for these dang slippers so I figure a review is well deserved.TLDR: Pregnant w\/ sore feet? BUY THESE. I swear by them!","2294":"I got the 7\/8 and a half and they are so loose I feel like if my feet get sweaty I might slip in them but they are comfy","2295":"YES - YES - YES - That is what I said when I first put these slippers on!!! As a person who has had plantar fasciitis for 20+ years and surgery on 1 foot (which was not successful), I LOVE THESE Slippers! They are now my new \"house shoes\") Didn't know when I put hardwood floors in my house, thus was going to cause my feet to hurt so bad after being on them all day.  I have a very high arch and most shoes cut into the top of my instep, but not these. I pop out of bed in the morning because my plantar fasciitis doesn't hurt me and these shoes are the reason. Needless to say, yes I have ordered another pair because MY FEET DON'T HURT!Now, I'm going to warn you, when I first put them on, it felt weird. Can't think of another way to explain it. Like I was walking on \"Marshmallows\" as others have said. But go slow and keep them on. Since I'm not sure if they need to compress around your feet or your feet need to sink into the slippers, but after about 15-20 mins the weirdness was gone and I was walking like normal. The next morning they fit great again and little to no compression of the fluffiness. Now, I haven't done the \"hair dryer\" fitting yet, but they fit pretty good at this point. Going up and down stairs is not a problem, but I wouldn't run in them. Also I don't think I will be wearing them to go shopping or any \"out of the house\" activity, but that's just me. Its kind of like my Crocs, I don't wear them to the grocery store or anywhere outside of my home. These slippers look OK, I'm just not comfortable doing this. But they are GREAT!","2296":"These are amazing \u2026so comfy \u2026a bit wide ..def better than the ones at WM\u2026I\u2019m gonna order more \u2026I bought the tan color","2297":"I got the 7.5-8.5, and I wear an 8.5. It was a loose fit and when I walk around I can\u2019t walk normally and have to make sure my feet are always up. If you want a more snug fit I would suggest sizing down a little.","2298":"Both feet feel like they are on the wrong foot.","2299":"3 months old and already ripped","2300":"I have very wide flat feet (mens 4E size 9) and have trouble finding any house shoes or slippers that fit and are supportive enough for my aching feet. Believe me, I\u2019m embarrassed by all the trouble these darn feet give me. I ordered a size 9. These felt a bit tight on first wear, but after a few hours they have remolded to my 4E width feet. I wish they had a little more lift in the arch but otherwise I\u2019m very happy with them, super soft and comfortable around the house. Great value. I think they look pretty modern too. I dig it.","2301":"Extremely comfortable and the softness is wonderful for my tired feet! Also, had foot surgery and has been comfortable to wear!","2302":"My daughter in law LOVES them","2303":"These are awesome. I have a lot of trouble with pain in my feet. I also have problems with swelling. So many pairs of shoes I've had to return due to them being too tight. These are great and if extra room is needed, just break out the blow dryer. I bought purple and navy. The sizing was consistent for both so I just ordered a rose red too. Black seems to be the one people are having trouble with size wise so I'm just gonna skip that color.","2304":"I appreciate the overall support and fit as well as the materials used to make the slippers.","2305":"These are so comfortable better than expected.  Plus the tan color goes with everything.  Easy to pack.  Washable. Perfect for summer.  Or around the house for slippers in winter time.  Lightweight but sturdy comfy slip ons.  Accommodates regular to wide width.  Will buy again in other colors.  Thanks for having these available in my size.","2306":"I really like these, but after the first time wearing them I got an insane rash and had to go on an antibiotic! I don\u2019t know if some substance got on them but I cleaned them well and I haven\u2019t really had an issue since!","2307":"My 12 year old granddaughter asked for these for her 12th birthday.  She loves them!","2308":"These shoes are so comfortable it's ridiculous. They are like walking on little temperpedic mattresses.I also have a rather large, and sensitive scar on the top of my foot (right where the ankle area meets the top of the foot) and these do not bother it at all because they are so smooth and soft. I'm definitely going to be purchasing more colors!","2309":"Very comfortable and well designed","2310":"I love these so much!!! They are so comfy!! I've  always loved wearing slippers around the house! and these are great! I even wear them outside the house now because they are just so comfy!","2311":"Love them!","2312":"I normally wear a 9.5 and I ordered the 9-10 and it was too small. I was really sad because they are so cute and comfy","2313":"Would love to write a review on how comfortable these shoes are but I've since had to return both orders as the first order the shoes were different sizes and the second time the shoes (even though we purchased the same 36-37 size) were oversized. In the short amount of time I had them, I can vouch that they are comfortable. Can't speak for the longevity though! Maybe third time will be the charm...(edit - not sure why my review says we got women's 10...we ordered the 6-7)","2314":"For every day wear most comfortable","2315":"I wish there was a way to tighten them around my foot. The shoe itself is very comfy but because the part that goes around the foot is so loose, it makes the shoes uncomfortable to walk in. I have a wider foot and it is still very loose.","2316":"So soft ! Love these ! Bought 2 pairs! And everyone a pair in my family !","2317":"I read an article about the comfort of these shoes and how they had such great reviews on Amazon, so I read the reviews and the price was great so I ordered myself a pair. When I received my order and put on the shoes I was so happy I bought them! They are so comfortable- like unbelievably comfortable. I am the type who hates shoes and never wears shoes in my home, and I find myself putting these on to walk around my house in because they are so comfortable! I highly recommend! I will be buying more in other colors!","2318":"I really wanted to love these sandals but I was very disappointed. They are not as comfortable or soft as I expected them to be. The fit just isn\u2019t right. They are not as cute as I thought. They are just not worth the money! Don\u2019t waste your time or money on these. I purchased the gray pair.","2319":"It's like walking on a cloud. It gives great support for your feet. For some reason, we bought this in Purple and Black and the purple one is true to size but the black one runs big. I would go down a size if you're buying the black colorway.","2320":"Had them for like a week took them to the beach and now they don\u2019t even fit anymore","2321":"I order these for my wife as a Mother\u2019s Day gift. She walking say they felt amazing. I got jealous an Oder me a pair. These slides or awesome.  We both love them.  Now my son is jealous guess I\u2019ll be getting him a pair.","2322":"I am a size 6-6.5 and would recommend that you size down if you have narrow or small feet! I purchased them in olive green and love the color, but was sad they did not fit - the arch is pretty wide so be aware if you have smaller feet.","2323":"This company is absolutely unscrupulous. If you do have to return them they will charge you approximately 30% of what the shoes cost to begin with. They are cheap material and I would never order again from this company!","2324":"I had a minor surgery on my toe and thought these would be a great shoe to get me through while I was recuperating\u2026they were great. I\u2019m almost healed and I\u2019m ordering another pair in a different color today!","2325":"When i first received them i was happy that they were comfortable, i even brought my daughter a pair.  We went to the pool and they got wet so we let them dry out in the sun and they shrunk.  They curled up and now they dont fit!","2326":"Y\u2019all, these were so used it\u2019s not even funny. I tried to laugh, because my luck, but it isn\u2019t funny. I was so excited to get these in the mail only to open them to a HORRIBLE smell (of stinky feet) dog hair and rocks in the bottom soles, the brand is rubbed off from the inside sole, shoes are covered in dirt and even a few white dots no telling what they are. I am so upset. I\u2019ve issued a refund but am posting this to warn other buyers! There\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll receive used shoes!","2327":"I was excited to purchase these shoes as I had heard great things about them. The bottoms of the shoes are soft and squishy but after walking in them for a few minutes they began rubbing the tops of my feet raw.","2328":"Comfortable...but way too small. Sizing is off.","2329":"I loved these at first, it was like walking on bouncy pillows. However, I noticed that they were too soft and start hurting the bottom of your feet. That\u2019s not why I am giving 1 star. One star is for the top portion of the slipper. It rubbed my skin raw. The top part is plastic and so wide. Your foot starts sweating from plastic and then it starts rubbing. I wanted to like them, but now they hurt as soon as I put them on. The only way I could wear them is with socks, but that\u2019s not the look I am going for.","2330":"Did not care for these. They fit horrible, they are so wide and the strap it way too big. Had to return them. But they are comfortable! So if you had wide feet they would be ideal.","2331":"Received the sandals, but did not open them to try them on. I could see through the plastic wrap that they were definitely not my style! Very bulky looking and appear more masculine than feminine!  Returned.","2332":"so bad nothing like cloud slides","2333":"So I ordered these for my husband who is a size 11 in Men's, they do not fit him--too small. But they do fit me (10 Women's) and I wear them all the time and really like them. So, I'd order a size up for Men's","2334":"These flip flops are very nice looking but very big and clumsy feeling. Hard on the foot .unfortunately,I have to say ,not happy with them. Returned.","2335":"THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHOE EVER!!!!!!!  Yes, I\u2019m one of those people that learned about these on Tik Tock (embarrassed to admit) but these are honestly the most cushy, soft yet sturdy, walking on a cloud shoe I\u2019ve ever worn.  Treat yourself to a pair, you\u2019ll be glad ya did!","2336":"These look like literal clown shoes. Sizing is waaaaay off. A women\u2019s size 9\/10 fits a women\u2019s size 12. Returned.","2337":"Comfy and usable for short and level distances in the  house but there is a big gap between sizes.  I got my own shoe size though no color I wanted was available and the slides were almost two inches too large.  I ordered the next size down, in black, the only available color, and those slides were too small.  Time to find a local market, pick a different brand and try them on.","2338":"I was going to order these until I read several reviews about the inconsistent sizes. Also, the video foot model Bronax used, did me in. Suggestion, don\u2019t use a foot model with scabby, chewed up feet when trying to sell shoes.","2339":"The black slides were rock hard. Not soft at all. Keep you products consistent!!!","2340":"I feel I have to review these even though I returned them months ago, because I do not understand or believe the rave reviews.  They were very narrow and hurt my feet, yet the two shoes were different lengths. Almost 1\/2\u201d different.  The top was rigid and the insole so squishy I felt unbalanced.  I wore in the house for 10 minutes just to try them anyway.  Horrible.  They look cute in the pictures but \u2026","2341":"Sides cut up too far","2342":"These are literally so comfy and worth the money!! My sister bought them for me as a gift while being pregnant. Very good especially if you have feet that get swollen fast! They\u2019re so comfy and feel good.","2343":"Very comfortable slippers. Recommend it for heel pain","2344":"Walking around the house these feel great for a couple of minutes. Wore them to the grocery store and came home with the worst blisters just below my toes EVER. The top of the shoes have rough edges and I can't figure out what to do to make it better. As of now they're unwearable :(","2345":"Ordered two different colors (same day) from this same seller.  One arrived a week earlier so I tried it on and it was a half size smaller than my foot.  What really bothered me was how wide they were.  The top and both sides did not touch my foot; an accident waiting to happen.I canceled this pair before arrival and sent the first pink ones back (same seller).  I really want a pair of these but haven\u2019t been able to fit into these crazy sizes.","2346":"I tried wearing these several times. They are hard plastic. They hurt the soles and tops of my feet. If you\u2019re expecting FitFlop or Lemon Jelly comfort, you won\u2019t get that from these.","2347":"I was doubtful that these slides would be that big of a deal, so I bought some for my wife to be our guinea pig. She loved them, so I ordered some as well. They are sooooo cushy that once you remove them your feet go into cushion withdrawal! Seriously, the cushy factor is off the chart. That being said, the men\u2019s sizes are a little weird, so shop the products that give you a foot length measurement in the images or description. I have size 10 feet, but the slides were only available in 10.5-11 or 9-10, so I went up a size and it worked out. My feet are narrow, so they fit loosely in the slide, but any normal feet would likely fit snug. I stand all day on hard floors, and in the summer these are amazing. I have made them part of my WFH wardrobe. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc","2348":"omg these are perfection. I didn\u2019t get all the hype at first but these things are like clouds. so so comfy and easy to clean if needed. The sizing is a little weird and I wish it would be cleared up more. I purchased the 7.5-8.5 size as i\u2019m usually an 8.5 and they do fit but I gotta say I have found myself tripping on them a few times when i first tried them out like they were a little big on me. I just wish they had their own individual sizes - or at least sizing that made more sense. but honestly the comfort level is amazing as long as u choose your right size","2349":"My husband and I both work from home and we only have hardwood, no carpets. And I ordered mine first and he got jealous of them so he ordered himself some and now we just waltz around all day in our squishy shoes. I wanted to only wear them inside like house slippers and then I accidentally wore them to the zoo Bc I have chronic pain and was having a hard day and just wanted comfort in my feet so now I think I have to order a second pair, one for outside, one for inside. I couldn\u2019t be happier with these and I mean if you\u2019re into comfort, buy them. They\u2019re great. Your feet will thank you for it.","2350":"These are so comfortable on my feet. I wear mostly around the house and my feet never hurt when I'm wearing them. Easy to slide on as well. I have recommended and my friends love them also.","2351":"This product is on the large size.  I ordered a 6-7. Had to reorder and go down a size.","2352":"These are the most comfortable slides ever! I have had foot surgeries and my foot swells and makes it difficult for me to fit my foot in certain shoes. That's never an issue with these. They are made of a soft rubber and are thick enough in the sole's that your feet feel supported.","2353":"Seriously glad these were a Win since the reviews for these are a bit mixed. Me personally I can say the ones that I ordered fit like a glove and are super comfy","2354":"Great shoes.  Priced better than those advertised on social media sites.","2355":"I have spurs in my heels and tile floors in my kitchen. These are wonderful for wearing around the house and for standing in to cook and wash dishes. My feet and knees don't hurt nearly as bad after wearing these to do house chores for over a week instead of regular slippers or sandals.","2356":"They fit great and they are so cushiony when you take them off you feel like you're like you're kind of like a big butt on the floor man that's funny I didn't think they would be that fluffy if that's such a thing","2357":"These are super comfy and soft! Size was perfect. I\u2019m gonna get some in more colors! You won\u2019t regret purchasing.","2358":"Extra soft and comfortable. True to size. Wide already, so if you don\u2019t have wide feet, it might be too wide for you and may need to size down. I have wide feet, and they are a bit wide on me.","2359":"They run small, I purchased for my upcoming cruise and would say I love them, if they fit better.","2360":"These are very comfy and super squishy. It feels like walking on a gymnastics mat. They offer zero support so if you need that these are not for you.","2361":"They fit nicely and are very comfortable. I got them to wear around the house as I\u2019m chasing kids around all day. I wear between a 6.5 and 7 in women's U.S. size. They fit just right. My husband was jealous that I didn\u2019t get him some as well (hehe, sucker!). I like the color and would purchase again. They came fairly fast. Teens, you can wear these with your vintage tube socks- I wish I looked as cool as you with them :(","2362":"These slides are super comfortable, they feel like memory foam! My only complaint is that they came 3 days late, thankfully just in time before i move. They also are kind of small even though i ordered the right size. These are definitely worth the purchase though so order a size up.","2363":"They are very comfortable. I wear between a size 8.5 and 9 in women. I ordered the 9 and it fits perfect. I feel like I'm walking on cushions.","2364":"These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. This is my 2nd pair and I love them. Wish I could wear them all the time!!","2365":"Super comfy!!!","2366":"Do your feet hurt? Do you chase crotch goblins all day? Are you ballin on a budget and cant afford high end stuff, like crocs? Well these are for you, thanks to tik tok. I put these on my feet, i thanked the lord almighty above. Doesnt hurt the kids at all if they pop off either. Jk. Literal clouds ya\u2019ll.","2367":"I see a lot of people complain that these shoes become very slippery when they're wet and I can only assume these people have not owned any other slides. I have Adidas slides that I paid over $60 for and they too get slippery When wet.This in particular slide fit as expected, was a little stiff the first few hours I was wearing it but seem to have gotten softer with more wear and I think they're a great value for the price. I needed to order a new pair and I needed them to come quick because I got contact cement all over my expensive ones and I was pleasantly surprised at the slides for the price. I wear a women's size 9.5-10 and I ordered a 40-41 and it fits perfect. I'm sorry others had such a bad experience with this slide but I did not. \ud83d\udc4d","2368":"Feels great","2369":"I always have slippers on when I\u2019m home. I usually buy fuzzy ones but they get worn and dirty so easy and they don\u2019t wash well. I saw these and figured they were worth a shot. They are THE most comfortable thing I\u2019ve ever had on my feet. They\u2019re like rubber so I thought they wouldn\u2019t be comfortable without socks but they\u2019re even more comfortable without socks. And they don\u2019t get dirty. I will be buying more pairs for sure.","2370":"I actually haven\u2019t worn mine yet as I bought for a new remodel with wood floors and I want to keep them clean to wear, indoors only, once we move in. They are very cushiony. Not supportive that I can tell, but will be fine on my hardwood floors. My two daughters (one who is very pregnant) love them. They wear theirs a lot\u2014indoors and out.","2371":"It's a great slipper and has been a wonderful boon on my cracked heels. Walking around the house is like walking on a cloud. I really recommend them","2372":"Soft and i will have to get use to the height.  I will not recommend this product to someone with  balance or equilibrium concerns.  Runs at least half size too small.  I normally use 9.5 size sandals.  I ordered a 9-10 pair of sandals and will not fit if I am wearing socks...","2373":"I wanted a pair of these pillow sandals for me, but all I do is gift them. These are HUGE! They don't pay attention to the size you ask for only the color. I just got out of the hospital and wanted these to wear inside. I lose..","2374":"I bought these on a whim but now I wear them everywhere! Very cute and stylish. They are a little small on my foot but still wearable. I would go up a size if I get another color.","2375":"I have plantar fasciitis and these help combat that pain. They\u2019re squishy, but still supportive. Comfortable right away and easy to clean. I will buy another pair!","2376":"Son s\u00faper c\u00f3modas  las mejores que he tenido y no resbalan se secan enseguida clienta feliz  se la recomiendo si quieren estar c\u00f3modas","2377":"My third pregnancy and really bad Plantar fasciitis. I wear these and it helps so much! So much cushion and support. Highly recommend!","2378":"These big slide ons have tremendously helped my right heel not to hurt!  These are amazing! By them!","2379":"I'm in love with these shoes, so comfortable, i need to order more asap","2380":"These are incredibly comfortable! I\u2019m a heavy walker and these are wonderful on my heels","2381":"These shoes are super comfy!","2382":"Very comfortable","2383":"Purchased for me will buy again","2384":"Love these!","2385":"Good quality","2386":"I love it so much it is so comfortable.","2387":"True to size.  Squishy but easy to walk in.  Comfortable.","2388":"You will love","2389":"I got mine yesterday and ordered a pair for my Mom today!","2390":"These are great for people with Back or Neck problems. I really enjoy my shoes.","2391":"Great Value for the money paid for my comfy shoes.","2392":"Purchased these after bone spur surgery. Any pressure on my bare heel sent me through the roof so I use these in the shower. Makes thing so much better. Very soft and provides a good amount of stability. Highly recommended","2393":"So comfortable!! I\u2019ll be ordering more for sure","2394":"Very comfortable and nice","2395":"I love this product. It's comfortable and fun!","2396":"The product is just as it said it was.  Good value at 17.99 to 19.99. It had gone up when I placed my order to 22.00??","2397":"Love it and very comfortable and u can walk everywhere \u2026 it\u2019s the best","2398":"Very comfortable, arrived quickly.  Would recommend.","2399":"Super comfy, like walking on clouds. OMG.","2400":"So comfortable and soft","2401":"These came in the correct size and they are squishy and very comfortable.","2402":"Walking in these at home is lovely. They are cushiony but supportive.","2403":"Soooo comfy. It didn\u2019t even matter that they were a size too big","2404":"Amazing. So comfy. Just what I was looking for.","2405":"These slippers are so comfy but I ordered a size 10.5\/11.5 women it's more like an 8.5. I reordered n gave these to my daughter she loves them too.I got them hoping they help my lower back pain. I'll try to update and tell how it's going.Update: these slippers have helped my back pain so much!!!Update againI ordered another pair and never received them says order is lost. Click for refund and it isn't refunding. Please refund me.UpdateI was sent another pair fairly quicklyThank you!","2406":"They are so comfy and offer great support. But they\u2019re pretty bulky and makes you feel like you shouldn\u2019t be wearing them after a while. Like an \u201cI need to take my shoes off\u201d feeling. I use them for around the house and cleaning but they trip me up a lot.","2407":"Super cute and comfortable. They do run a bit small so I would size up. Overall they  are amazing","2408":"True to size, soft and spongy, good support.  Love them! They stay on my feet and feel form fitted to my feet.  Great purchase.","2409":"These shoes were uncomfortable for me.","2410":"I purchased these to use in my garage when I need a pair of shoes to slip on quickly.  They are very comfortable and will be easy to clean.","2411":"True to size, soft and spongy, good support.  Love them! They stay on my feet and feel form fitted to my feet.  Great purchase.","2412":"They are so comfy and offer great support. But they\u2019re pretty bulky and makes you feel like you shouldn\u2019t be wearing them after a while. Like an \u201cI need to take my shoes off\u201d feeling. I use them for around the house and cleaning but they trip me up a lot.","2413":"I've been suffering with a pinched nerve in my foot for several months, my doctor attributes it to walking barefoot on my hardwood floors - these slides are super cushy and take the pressure off the pinched nerve. I can walk around the house without pain again.","2414":"The media could not be loaded.","2415":"I really like this slipper\/shoe alot. I have alot of pain in my feet and legs, and wearing this slipper has helped ease my pain. The sole is thick and kind of springy, and very cute too.","2416":"Bought several pair","2417":"I had purchased two separate pairs of these. The first pair was way too large and fell right off my feet when I walked. I am a size 10 women's and these fit more like a size 10 mens. The second pair I bought, I sized down one sizing option and now they came wayyy too small. They fit like a women's 7 on me. The sizing is inconsistent and incorrect by what they label the options to be. I love the feeling of these sandals, but I would simply recommend to purchase these sandals from another company with more accurate sizes.","2418":"I\u2019m a size 8 generally and the 7.5-8.5 are perfect but i wouldn\u2019t want any smaller","2419":"I normally don't rave about things,  but I love this. Listen, don't buy it for support, it's softest thing I've ever put on my feet. Definitely indoor shoes. After a hard days work, nothing like slipping these on while doing my chores. Definitely recommend it.","2420":"Okay","2421":"Happy","2422":"I little large so next time I will order one size down","2423":"I saw someone talking about these online that they were like walking on clouds. I was skeptical, but I figured it couldn't hurt to try them. They were 100% right. I adore them!! They are wonderful in the house or out of the house. They fit true to size. And it's like I have clouds on my feet! I will be ordering more pairs soon!","2424":"These shoes are simple the best! I wear them all the time. Such great support, you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re wearing shoes!","2425":"Fit perfectly and very comfortable.","2426":"I wear these as house slippers and love them! Super cushy which is great for those with heel issues. They are a bit clunky, so if you\u2019re not sure footed or have a lot of stairs to conquer each day, they might be a bit cumbersome at the tips (think trippy)\u2026 otherwise, for main level floor comfort, wonderful!","2427":"I ordered one pair of these shoes in my regular size. Two big. I ordered this pair, and they fit perfect. I love this color.","2428":"Wear them all day!  Ordering more colors","2429":"Worth the hype!","2430":"These shoes are simple the best! I wear them all the time. Such great support, you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re wearing shoes!","2431":"I little large so next time I will order one size down","2432":"Ordered a 7.5-8.5 being a 7-7.5 thinking they were going to fit. Nope way to small","2433":"Love, Love, Love these Slippers!!!  They\u2019re the right density, the right material, & the right price.I would recommend them to everyone!","2434":"Nice and soft","2435":"My husband has to plantar fasciitis and he love this indoor slippers! Perfect!","2436":"I love these shoes they are very comfortable. Yes comfortable \u263a\ufe0f","2437":"It's a shame. The cushion on these are AMAZING. The problem is if you have wide feet they are too tight. Such a shame. Length wise they are slightly shorter but not too far off.","2438":"Quite comfortable and soft. The wide strap really helps since I have difficulty lifting a weak left leg.","2439":"These actually FIT across bridge of foot!!!!!  Excellent!!!!!","2440":"I love these so much\u2026 extremely cushy, comfortable and supportive. They make my feet feel so much better.","2441":"These actually FIT across bridge of foot!!!!!  Excellent!!!!!","2442":"I Love them very soft and comfy, just like walking on a cloud.","2443":"I try to find an excuse to wear these shoes whenever I can because they are so comfortable. even though it\u2019s almost winter these slides are extra comfy paired with fuzzy socks","2444":"I love these! Will definitely buy another pair. But size up. I\u2019m an 11. And got the 12\/13 and it fits perfectly!!","2445":"Great home slippers. Looks bulky but it\u2019s lightweight and very well cushioned. I see why it\u2019s so popular.","2446":"These are not the cutest shoes but SO comfy for around the house. They\u2019re a tad bulky but overall definitely worth it.","2447":"These slippers are no good they're Slippery When Wet to the point of being dangerous and they are sticky when they are dry.","2448":"Excellent fit for someone who needs to have toes completely out, (especially after surgery). Soft and supportive","2449":"These slides are the perfect house shoe, and very comfortable! The only thing I\u2019ll say is the color olive is more like a mustard green color, not what I expected but very minimal issue.","2450":"These slides are the perfect house shoe, and very comfortable! The only thing I\u2019ll say is the color olive is more like a mustard green color, not what I expected but very minimal issue.","2451":"Very confortables","2452":"I love how they go up to a size 15 for women","2453":"If I could wear these all day to work I would. The only thing that I can wear with a fractured foot without wearing my walking cast. Do comfortable and I love them. Buying more to be sure.","2454":"They are great so far no complaints here.","2455":"So comfortable and great fit","2456":"Very comfortable and relieved my heel pain.","2457":"I\u2019ve been wearing Berkies  for the last four years and the price has simply skyrocketed so I was forced to choose something else.I am very pleased they are very comfortable and support my whole foot simultaneously","2458":"I ordered the blush in my normal size. I wear a 7 and ordered the 6\/7. They fit great. My feet do sweat normally so the texture of these do make my feet sweat but it\u2019s not a biggie. They are very comfortable. I would recommend them!","2459":"Comfortable,  cushion,  easy to wear.  These are a little to big for my feet but, they do show you how to  get the shoe to fit your feet.  I wear compression socks with mine so I don't mind the lossless. Will be purchasing more.","2460":"They are REAL comfortable.  I usually wear a size 8 and they run a little wide but they are fine. I wouldn't go smaller because then they would be too sug and therefore not as comfy. :)","2461":"I love these things. I want to wear them everywhere. My feet are super swollen at 8 months pregnant and these are great for when my feet hurt and are uncomfortable in other shoes.","2462":"I had to return as there is zero support which made them difficult to walk in and wear.","2463":"They fit well. There is some pressure spots that rub on your toes. I can only wear them for a few hours before I have to take them off.","2464":"With any shoes, I must have 9W.  I ordered 9-10 women\/7.5-8.5 men.  I was worried about the size, but it fits perfectly!  My left is a little narrow, about 1\/2 inches less than my right foot is wider because of the surgical correction.  The slide sandal shoes give some space and are very comfortable.  My right foot is a little wider than my left (a little loose), I don't care, but it is worth it!  I feel comfortable as long as it doesn't hurt my right foot and with help, like walking a CLOUD, even like a HEAVEN!  :-)  THANK YOU!!","2465":"I wear these everyday and they are still my favorite shoe! I\u2019m ordering in like every color \ud83d\ude02","2466":"They are really soft anda comfortable","2467":"I love these slip ons!!! They are perfect!","2468":"Just buy them! Best house slipper! (Especially if you have hardwood floors!) Perfect fit! Perfect comfort! I have bought a lot of memory foam sandals but their foam doesn\u2019t last a week. These sandals foam has not lost ANY thickness and doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to lose any anytime soon! 100000\/10","2469":"Really feels great on Plantar Facitus...my feet are very picky","2470":"These things make you feel like you walking on clouds! I think I bought 5 different colors. A must buy!","2471":"En general est\u00e1n bien ,quedan Justo a la medida y son muy c\u00f3modas y suaves .","2472":"These are amazing!","2473":"They are a little large I would go a size down. They are very soft and comfy","2474":"Really feels great on Plantar Facitus...my feet are very picky","2475":"Super comfy but runs small.","2476":"it\u2019s like walking on clouds. so easy to clean too!","2477":"Excellent foot relief I now have 2nd pair","2478":"Sizes are not true, wasn\u2019t what I thought they would be as for as quality.","2479":"The thickness is ok! But they runs small have to buy 2 sizes bigger to fit perfectly!","2480":"I saw these on many reviews and thought I would give them a try. Love them so comfy I can wear all day long and no pain or blisters. I got a size 7.5-8.5 and they are a little bit big loose. Not really sure how to care for the shoes no care instructions. I will just wipe down with disinfectant wipe. Don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe to go in washing machine might damage the shoes. Bought cushionaire before and they suck bronax way better.","2481":"Bought a pair for my husband but the strap is tight. The length is good and there very soft. He has a hard time getting them off and on.","2482":"The thickness is ok! But they runs small have to buy 2 sizes bigger to fit perfectly!","2483":"It is comfy to wear around the house. A bit chunky however but does the job.","2484":"Like walking on a cloud!","2485":"Awesome fit and very comfy !!","2486":"Very comfortable.","2487":"I like these, but they're just a bit too large. I normally wear a woman's size 5, so I ordered the 4.5-5 option. When I put my foot in, I have a little extra room in the back by the heel.","2488":"I put these on as soon as I received them. The color is the perfect neutral tan, and I wear 6.5, so 6-7 fit perfectly. Not overly narrow or wide. I have knee problems and I wore these all day doing errands. They are very comfortable and eased the strain on my knees. I plan on wearing these outside everyday until my knees feel better. Great price for these shoes which seem high quality. They are kind of futuristic and stylish, and can be dressed up or down.","2489":"These slides are awesome, way better than I expected however make sure you size up. I'm a \"size 7\" and I didn't want them to be tight so I could wear them with socks in the Fall so I ordered a size 7 1\/2 to 8 1\/2 and they fit me perfect as you can see in my photos. I have wide feet so I was so happy that they came wide enough for me to use them with or without socks. I highly recommend these shoes, they are very comfortable!! I hope this review helps you but be sure to size up a half a size or you will be returning them.","2490":"Be careful though,  sometimes they make you trip on your foot.  The front of them bends somehow.  But they are comfy.","2491":"Love it . Very comfy to wear around the house","2492":"muy comodas y blandas, justo lo que esperaba","2493":"My foot pain melted away - they are great.  I had ordered from a different vendor\/company and these are the real deal.  Great fit - I went up a size.  The stretchy-ness of the band doesn\u2019t detract, they are easy to walk in but an extremely slender foot might find them wide.  I have a normal foot.","2494":"They are so comfy! Durable and worth the money","2495":"Bought for my mom and she wants a pair in every color now!","2496":"I did not like these.  Yes, they are cushiony and at first very comfortable.  But after wearing for about 15 minutes my feet and calves hurt.","2497":"Okay, if you wake up with sore feet and hate that morning painful walk right out of bed. These slippers are for you. I keep them at the edge of my bed, slip these puppies on and it has so much cushion it's insane. Now I bought two pair and I thought they ran small. The first pair I got we're too small for my daughter, who the sandals were for originally. I kept them for myself and bought her these black ones just one size bigger. The only complaint was the part that goes over your foot was larger as well. So the size was right but the top was too big. \ud83d\ude12. She just wears them with socks to help keep them in place. No sure if all larger sizes do this. Either or great slippers, I bought them at $20. Looks like they went up on price. \ud83d\ude11","2498":"I have 2 painful foot disorders (stump neuroma, CRPS Type 2) and while these aren\u2019t the answer to all my dreams, they sure come close! My feet tend to be overly sensitive to the touch of various materials, so I was concerned about the material used. I\u2019m easily able to tolerate these. But when I first got them, I planned to return them as the top strap was too wide, and my feet slipped out far too easily. The foot-bed, however, was perfect. I tried heating them with my hairdryer but that did nothing for me. After reading about this, I put them in the dryer on highest heat, with a damp towel, and checked on them every 5 minutes so I wouldn\u2019t shrink them too much. You\u2019ll need to wear socks to try them if you use this method. I left mine at a little too big, and as it turns out, that\u2019s the best size to slip in and out, yet I\u2019m able to easily keep them on my feet \u2013 having worn them day in, day out, I\u2019ve not once slid out while walking. Also, I put a bit of foot powder on the foot-beds as it helps with the oversensitivity I suffer from.I\u2019m back to order 2 more pair. They are not attractive \u2013 overly wide and look like I\u2019m walking on big rubber pillows, but frankly, they way they make my feet feel, I can live without pretty!","2499":"The media could not be loaded.","2500":"I love them.  The cushion is the magic  Great support and fit.  I will buy another pair.  If they hold up well","2501":"I\u2019ve had them all summer wore in and out the house. On my feet all day best recovery sandals ever. Will continue to buy. Lightweight with a support on feet and legs.","2502":"One of my favorite Amazon purchases. Great quality and extremely comfortable. They are very bulky and run a little large. I\u2019m typically a 7 or 7.5, I ordered a 7.5 and wish I got the 7.","2503":"This is the fourth pair of pillow slippers I\u2019ve tried in the past week. These and the ones from Joomra have been the best so far. These just seem more true to size. Feel like I\u2019m waking on air.","2504":"I bought these to wear around the house to help with my pain that I get in my feet. These suckers are so comfortable! I have been wearing them outside the house because of how comfy they are. I don't care how darn ugly they are! Comfort over beauty!","2505":"Most comfortable slide.","2506":"Like walking on clouds!","2507":"I love these slippers! The support is great and they make no noise when you walk. It\u2019s like walking on air!","2508":"Era lo que esperaba","2509":"Super comfortable especially if you\u2019re standing all day","2510":"Ordered 2 pairs so far.. First pair I wore everyday for a month. Still perfect condition. Ordered 2nd pair for my daughter who has foot issues. She wore mine for a day and said she had no foot fatigue, which amazed her. My husband and her husband now want me to order them each a pair.  Geez.. I have a large family.","2511":"Didn\u2019t want to spend $70 on the oofos slides so ended up trying these out. I ordered my usual size 7 and the fit was as expected. Really like the blush color, it\u2019s more of a purple-tone. Once I was nearing the end of my 2nd trimester of pregnancy, it was hard to stand on my feet for more than 30m around the house. Once I got these, they were such a game changer! They are so soft and cushiony and I\u2019m able to be on my feet for a really long time without feeling any discomfort. Highly recommend these.","2512":"These are super comfortable, like crazy good","2513":"Quality of item was magnificent. Delivery was notably fast. Ravishing packaging. Outstanding seller.","2514":"They slide off my feet a little, which is weird because the same size in the pink color almost felt a little too small. So note that the sizes are not exactly the same from color to color due to properties that change with that. Overall, great product and very pleased with the level of comfort. Love them!","2515":"Nothing to dislike, very comfortable,  it feels like you are walking on air.","2516":"On the left is a size 7 1\/2 . Now I\u2019m ordering a size 6.","2517":"These slippers are perfect around the house. They are wide and do not pinch my feet, yet are not too large where they flop off easily. I love these slippers and would recommend them to anyone.","2518":"Support and comfort","2519":"Very soft and comfy to walk on. Non-slip sole means you can wear around a pool with no problem!","2520":"I've had Neuropathy in both feet for over ten years now, and am unable to wear most shoes. I ordered these shoes intentionally a size larger than I normally wear, and they have been a wonder. They feel so pillow-soft on the bottom for me, and the larger size ensured the top part (that goes over your foot) didn't rub. I'll admit, I went back and got a second pair in my size, and those did rub a bit, so I'm breaking them in more slowly, but I'm so happy with these shoes. Wonderful.","2521":"Foot issues.","2522":"I bought these as shower shoes as I am in the navy and it\u2019s a communal shower. They are great for that purpose.","2523":"Extremely comfortable, like walking on pillows","2524":"Great support and comfortable","2525":"PERCECT fit.  Very comfortable.","2526":"These are good shower shoes to have. So comfy and squishy in a good way. I wish I had gone up a size but still great for showers.","2527":"I am writing this review to possibly help those who also have issues with their feet, as I do. I have Neuropathy, and I feel as though I'm walking on hot coals and shards of glass at the same time. These shoes are heavenly! They are very cushy, but do not allow you to sink to the floor, and I am a heavier person. I know my feet will still hurt, but I feel these will help tremendously. I wish they were a bit more aesthetically pleasing, but when your feet hurt, you will try anything.","2528":"These are bananas comfy, and completely puppy proof! I have a 6mo collie puppy, and he got ahold of these one night, chewed them ALL NIGHT, and when I woke up and saw him with them I kinda freaked... but they were completely unscathed! No puncture marks, no little teeth indents, and the slobber was easy to wipe off. I'm seriously impressed.","2529":"Fits as expected","2530":"I love them so much! I have a minor stress fracture and I can walk around in these! I only got them today and I already received compliments on them too!","2531":"I love these! They are very comfortable and I wear them around my house all the time. They especially help when my heel spur is acting up.","2532":"These are the most comfortable slippers ever.  I have hard wood flooring and these give perfect cushions for your feet. I've bought 2 more pair for gifts.","2533":"Muy c\u00f3modas","2534":"Love these! They are perfect just to slip on for the and they are super comfortable!","2535":"Great shower and lounge shoes","2536":"Fit","2537":"The comfort and fit are amazing even for me with a very high instep!","2538":"So comfy, I liked everything about them!!!","2539":"I'm a socks and slides type of female, if you asked me I'd say these are perfect for that. They are comfortable, simple and slightly attractive with the right pair of socks, of course lol","2540":"Not bad! One shoe was a little loose so following online instructions I heated the shoe with my wife\u2019s blow dryer and it does fit better. Overall, I am satisfied with the shoes and after wearing most of the day I did not have any foot pain. Being a diabetic, finding shoes that help reduce foot pain is very important. These help.","2541":"Going out.. walking in the beach.","2542":"It\u2019s sometimes sticks when you walk. Other than that it is the most coveted shoe in my home. Everyone wants it so comfortable","2543":"They are very comfortable. Most of the slides make annoying sounds on wood floor, these ones do better when trying to be quiet.","2544":"I have been looking at athletic slides to find some I could wear post-run and after high impact workouts. My feet get achey as I have high arches. I was going to splurge and buy a much more expensive pair. Decided to give these a try instead. I absolutely love them! They were instantly comfortable and very supportive. I'm going to buy more colors!","2545":"I love these comfortable shoe, they are not just to wear them when you\u2019re getting out of the shower, I wear them every day\/everywhere. They are just that comfortable. I will be buying another pair.","2546":"Definitely comfy and super supportive. However they do shrink in the sun. More of a house shoe and not a beach or pool dangle.","2547":"Absolutely love these!!!","2548":"They are the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn.  It truly feels like if you were walking in the clouds.  Of course I would not know how that would feel but I have imagination.  They truly are just perfect.  My feet are always in pain and oh boy let me tell you that you will feel the pain subside right away. I truly recommend these sandals to anyone.","2549":"Got for my mom and she loves them","2550":"They are the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn.

The length is perfect and for once my wife toe box is no problem. They are, I dare say, a little wide for me. However, for this price I will take it. I am wearing these as house slippers not shower shoes. I don\u2019t think they will last long, but if they hold up even 6 months I will be ok with that, since I wear my house shoes most of the time now. ;)","2553":"They are very comfortable. I wear them everywhere. Ideal for summer easy to wash off!","2554":"I wear these shoes around the house sometimes outside they are the most comfortable most sturdy shoes ever I recommended to all my friends they are definitely an essential to have in your closet","2555":"Very comfortable shoes. Got these shoes for my daughter who is an 8 1\/2. They were a little small for her. I am an 8 and they were a perfect fit for me.

Good choice.","2568":"These slippers are excellent for cushioning.  I get cortisone injections in my knees and hip every 3 months. These have really taken the edge off especially at the end of the 3 month period when it's time for my injections again.I was wearing an old worn out pair of standard nurse's shoes and these are much better.I will say that they turn sideways on your foot very easily if you are wearing socks with them.  Even if you are stepping a little sideways on even a 1\/2\" incline instead of straight or front on, they slip right around.Those with balance problems, be careful. I'm not sure if they slip so easily without socks.  It's winter here and I've always worn socks with them.I ordered a size larger and they fit perfectly.I ordered","2569":"I had bought a similar sandal last year and my foot slid right through it.  Happily, these fit very nicely!  I also have a problem with my Achilles heel, so I wanted something cushy, and these do the trick.  Unfortunately, after wearing them for three days, my big toe on my right foot got irritated and I had to stop wearing them.  I read that wearing socks would help - but not in this heat!  I'll try again this week but put a cushioned bandaid on my toe to see if that helps.","2570":"So so comfy","2571":"This shoes are not the most stylish ones but for a home wear shoes they are the most comfortable .","2572":"So comfortable. These slippers help to relieve my aches and pains. I highly recommend them.","2573":"Love these slides!

I\u2019m buying a second pair for my mom too.","2582":"Comfortable but runs small","2583":"I have plantar fascists, and these shoes are comfortable and offer decent support.

GET THEM!!!","2587":"I\u2019ve been wanting a pair of these for awhile and decided to buy a pair during Prime Day. These are super comfortable and squishy! The only downfall on this purchase was that I ordered \u201cBlush\u201d and instead I received an \u201cOlive Green\u201d pair. Slightly disappointed about that, but I do like the Olive Green!","2588":"Once you tried them on.. You are floating in air. Really the best so far... I love them","2589":"These are just awesome ! Very soft and much support. I can wear these all day . Not as expensive, but a great choice if u want comfort. They are so easy to clean too.","2590":"Perfect for around the house to prevent foot fatigue and pain from waking on hard floors! I wanted something easy to slip in and out of that wasn't a standard flip flop or house slipper. Seeing this style becoming more popular even though it isn't the most attractive I wanted to give it a try. Very happy with the purchase. Comfortable, like walking on squishy sand, and sizing is perfect, ordered the 7.5-8.5; normally wear 7.5 sandal 8 running shoe. Decent arch support and toe elevation which surprisingly alleviates my Morton's neuroma discomfort. Feet don't hurt!","2591":"So comfy for wearing around the house and are well worth the price. Highly recommend.","2592":"I have seen this all over Tik Tok and Pinterest!! I have a condition that causes my body to hurt 24\/7 so I thought why not give these a try and see if they help my feet.Shipping was fast (as most time with Amazon), packaging very simple, and easy to open. The smell was a little strong when I first opened them but that went away pretty fast.I\u2019ll start with the only down side for me, the size. So I am a size 8 so I went with the 7.5 to 8.5, thinking ok it might be a little big but that\u2019s fine, wrong! My heel is right at the edge, so if you are an 8.5 I would suggest sizing up! Or if you are someone that does like to have you heel touch the edge size up.Other than that these are great! I had them on for a full day, put them next to by bed so I\u2019m the night if I got up I slipped them on. The next morning the pain in my feet was significantly less!!","2593":"These are great slipper to wear around the house. They are very comfortable with support.","2594":"I bought these as a gift, was told they were super soft and very comfortable, the only issue is her shoe size, these were a little too large for her normal size. But she loved them and say they were really great slippers.","2595":"Wow I really, really like these pillow slippers. As advertised, they are sooooooo comfortable and cushiony, which is why I purchased them. I walk on hardwood floors most of the day, and that is hard on my knees.

More cushy than my Crocs","2597":"A great buy, very nice","2598":"Just like walking on clouds! I will probably end up ordering more pairs when the time comes! Super comfortable and easy to break in.

I highly recommend!!","2600":"I liked the fit and could wear them wherever","2601":"I call them my cloud shoes!","2602":"I love the beautiful color and the softness of this slipper. I will be ordering more if the price stays the same.","2603":"So far, I like how to shower shoes are, it has the same feeling as comfy slides!","2604":"I was super excited about these & automatically when I tired them on I was super disappointed.

Definitely my go to shoe.","2610":"Comfortable shoe for in the house, nice cushioned heel.","2611":"I was happy with the comfort and size.","2612":"These are really comfortable on hard surfaces. I got them to have something easy clean and quick change to wear for work outside a bit or for a short walk out or whatever. They're so comfortable, I might get a pair for inside when I have to stand for long periods. The band is not adjustable, so you might need to wear with socks if they're too loose there. So far, I'm very happy with this purchase!","2613":"Comfy!","2614":"Delivery time is very important to me and time was excellent as well as the product","2615":"They are good quality.

I was skeptical, but not anymore! Highly recommended!","2622":"They are very comfy and look good also. They are bulky but that\u2019s the style.","2623":"Very similar to adidas cloud foam shoes. They seem to run a smidge big. I\u2019m 6.5\/6 and ordered 6. I\u2019m not sure I would size down but just something to be aware of when purchasing. Extremely comfy and even though they\u2019re bulky\/chunky looking they\u2019re super cute.","2624":"These are seriously the comfiest shoes I have ever worn! they are perfect for an errand run or just around the house wear! highly recommend this brand!!","2625":"I wear these often I need to order in ask colors","2626":"I wanted a pair of rubber slippers for the house.  I have hardwood floors and didn't want to hear my footsteps, so the rubber keeps my walk silent.  I am a size 6.5 and bought a size 7 and the slipper looks pretty big on my foot (sizing up was recommended).  They are comfortable and will serve their purpose, but they are not that pretty on the foot.  I opted for the comfort and kept them.","2627":"The reason why I ordered these slippers, I have had surgery on my feet. Can't wear regular flip -flops. These are comfortable.","2628":"So Comfy!!!!!!!!!!!","2629":"Cute and comfortable","2630":"Somewhat hard not as soft as expected.","2631":"Comfortable slides. The material is not the best but it\u2019s doable. I wish they were a little softer but not bad if you use them a lot and they break in. Couple weeks and the logo has begun to fade away.

My feet are very narrow and these are for a more normal width or wider foot. They felt like they\u2019d slide off my feet very easily. I wish they made them for narrow feet as well. I love them otherwise!!","2647":"Comfort","2648":"I got these for my mom who is 65 and she loves them.

Glad I got \u2018em!!","2656":"Extremely comfortable when dry. Extremely dangerous when wet. When wet, you need to take very small steps to avoid your foot from sliding through the sandal, twisting your ankle. Sometimes the sandals rotate around your wet foot too. You can seriously break your ankle in an instant wearing these when wet. This happens even though they are a snug fit when dry. I predict a CPSC recall on these sandals.","2657":"These are the most comfortable slip ons I've ever owned.","2658":"Very comfortable!","2659":"Very comfortable, would purchase again!","2660":"These are Phenomenal!

Doesn\u2019t fit.","2668":"These are really comfortable!","2669":"These slippers are like walking on CLOUDS.  I e never had anything so comfortable.  Now Jake a winter version and line them with something warm so I don\u2019t have to wear socks.  lol","2670":"Definitely wide width otherwise a nice shoe. Very comfy.

Very happy with my purchase.","2675":"I love these as it makes you feel like you're walking on a pillow. Worth the money \ud83d\udcb0","2676":"I wear these everyday. The color is so cute. They are the most comfortable shoes I own. I have worn them at the beach, walking, and as house shoes!! I\u2019m obsessed!!! I do think they run a little small! I\u2019m normally a 8.5-9 and these I got a 9-10!","2677":"I don\u2019t know why anyone would pay $80 for sandals just like these because they have a fancy name. These are actually better than the expensive ones. I find them to be softer and more durable. Don\u2019t waste your money on the namebrand these are great!","2678":"I order these for my wife she loves them she said they feel so comfortable I feel like Iam in a cloud","2679":"I loved all of the color choices. When I got mine in I put them on and was extremely impressed with the support from a foam shoe. They\u2019re also extremely comfortable and great for at home wear our wearing them out!","2680":"I order these for my wife she loves them she said they feel so comfortable I feel like Iam in a cloud","2681":"I love that the sandals are cute and comfortable.  Because of the simple style, I can pair them with anything.  Even though I only wear them in the house.  I can\u2019t afford the Yeezy\u2019s so I got these lol!","2682":"Great sandals that are nicely soft but still supportive and very comfy. Blue color is nice; the green was more light olive and was returned","2683":"One of the best products I bought on Amazon,,, I don't need a kitchen mat anymore I can stand on my feet for hours and my feet does not hurt,, This product is great lives up to its name","2684":"I get so tired standing on the wood floor while I cook everyday, soI was looking for slippers with a nice cushion. Price is right and I really like the thick cushion. Very satisfied.","2685":"I'm lady loves them gonna get me a pair soon","2686":"They are so comfortable and soft they are my go to shoes soon as I get off a long shift at work!","2687":"Liked","2688":"Comfortable and soft","2689":"I use these shoes for around the house and outside by the pool. I wasn\u2019t sure what size to get but keep in mind they do run large. Mine still were a little big but after leaving them in the sun for a bit they did shrink. They are super comfortable cloud like shoes and I would recommend a pair for everyone!","2690":"Some shoes are too big, but they are soft and comfortable. They are worth buying","2691":"These shiws are great as shower shoes. The cushioning for people with back and knee problems is outstanding.","2692":"I really like these, they are comfortable and so cute! They do look a little big but I feel it adds to their comfiness","2693":"I love these slippers, I use them everywhere and they are more comfortable than any slides or sandals I've ever used. I've only had them for a few days and can't speak on the longevity of these slippers but the comfort would be worth buying another pair in a year or so.","2694":"I think these slides are hideous looking; I bought them for comfort, but the looks are growing on me. It really does feel like you're walking on clouds. It feels really weird walking on the floor after taking them off. I bought these just to wear around the house, but I might wear them in public now too.","2695":"Very good cushion comfort","2696":"These are very cushy. I love just throwing them on to go to work (healthcare and I change into scrubs at work) I followed the heating instructions, didn\u2019t notice it molding much but still comfy. The only thing I would change is I\u2019d make them a bit more snug around the toe opening. This part is very big even when I wear socks with them but still not enough to make me not wear them. Good comfy sandals for decent price","2697":"I ordered my first pair which fit perfectly. I needed a second pair so I could an outside pair and inside pair and the two pairs I ordered after the first pair were HUGE. So big that the shoes come off when I walk. I thought I ordered a different\/wrong brand they were so big and felt different. The way the seller packages them expands the material making the plastic stretch way too big. (The way they package is shown in the picture) I used to recommend these but I don\u2019t anymore. Please change the way you package them seller. Returning my second pair.","2698":"I\u2019m 3rd trimester pregnant & these shoes have saved my feet! My swollen feet hurt so bad to walk for even short amounts of time but these shoes made it to where I can walk for a long time. Literal lifesavers. Wish I could give it more stars","2699":"I am definitely a fan of this shoe, I ordered a size 9 they run kind of big so I return them for a size 8 1\/2, they are TRULY Really\u2014  comfortable , lightweight i\u2019m walking on air, I can wear them all day will definitely buy them again!! The scale from 1 to 10 definitely a 10\u2014 Mary R.","2700":"Bought them for my wife to use around the house and yard. They fit her perfectly and she loves them. She says it feels like she\u2019s walking on clouds, they\u2019re so soft.","2701":"Very good cushion comfort","2702":"These are very cushy.

Good comfy sandals for decent price","2703":"Love these have 3 pairs just hate it has the scuff as these ones are my favorite color but hate to have to go through all the trouble of returning them","2704":"Run a little big but don\u2019t care, I love these and wear them everyday.  So comfortable and no sore feel when standing for a long time.  A little bulky to use for walking long distances.","2705":"I ordered two of these from 2 different sellers. The red fit and the gray is too small. I did order the same size! The size isn\u2019t on the slides. So maybe a mistake or maybe one seller runs small? The slides are exactly the same! Just sizing is off. These will go back. Keeping the red!","2706":"Love these messin around shoes","2707":"Great to walk around the house, so comfy","2708":"Got them today and already deciding what colors to get next. These are fluffy, puffy, supportive, marshmallow clouds of joy. They fit perfectly leaning slightly toward the larger size in the given range which is great for me\u2014I like wearing socks with these type of slides around the house because slippery sweaty sandal foot feeling isn\u2019t for me. They don\u2019t run small but they don\u2019t run too big either for a medium width foot with a high arch. The tan color is a nice neutral upscale tan, no weird reddish or yellow tones. I thought they might be super unattractive (was pulled in by the comfort potential for back support) but they are really kinda cute, bit of a dad\/mom-chic vibe. I really never want to be without this feeling and I can\u2019t say the same for my cloudfoams or ultrabounce. I\u2019ll see how they break in and update with my next purchase. I wish they came in a lot more colors. Amazing value for the price.","2709":"Lots of support but like walking on a cloud","2710":"Great to walk around the house, so comfy","2711":"Got them today and already deciding what colors to get next.

Trust me, just get these.","2713":"Feels like walking on marshmallows! Love them.","2714":"Choose your right size","2715":"Love them!","2716":"Ordered a pair for me and a pair for my husband as his and hers practical gifts.  Very comfy.  My husband has back problems and these help to relieve some of the pain.  We wear these inside only as house shoes","2717":"To lounge around in","2718":"A little to wide","2719":"I love these shoes!  They are so comfortable!  I almost bounce when I walk--it's effortless!  I think they're so ugly that they're cute!  The top piece across the top of my foot does get a little sweaty on hot days, but they are so comfy and cute that I can forgive that.  Planning on getting other colors!","2720":"Very comfortable, great for my room slippers, and I regret not buying these sooner.","2721":"I love these. They\u2019re actually soft, unlike other sellers. I\u2019m a size 5-5.5, I got 4-5.5. They were a little too loose on me. Other sellers have fit me better, but no where near as comfy & soft. Since they look a little big on top of being such a chunky shoe, I\u2019ll reserve them for only the house bc I won\u2019t send them back. They help my feet pain & I want multiple pairs, I just wish they fit more snug around my foot","2722":"Love them!","2723":"A little to wide","2724":"I love these shoes!  They are so comfortable!

They are very soft and comfortable.","2726":"I was so excited and loved them when I first put them on. But the second day of wearing them, the sides of my toes started to burn. From rubbing, I guess. The third  day, the outside of my feet started burning, too. Now, I don't think I can wear them anymore! I was hoping the would start feeling better, but seems they are getting worse. We'll see what tomorrow brings.","2727":"I purchased to wear on the beach and they did not disappoint me at all. They were perfect for maneuvering through the sand and are comfy","2728":"So I ordered these and had them delivered to my I laws house during the fourth and needless to say all the women there tried them on and ordered them. I will say don\u2019t get them wet. I whiped out pretty good. Def need to post that\u2026 slippery when wet!","2729":"These are great to \"slide on\" to take the dog out of a morning.  Also, quite comfortable.","2730":"There were a lot of these type shoes to purchase. I\u2019m happy I got this brand. Very comfy and soft and fit as expected","2731":"3 generations of cloud slip on.","2732":"Love these! Support and comfort is great!","2733":"Not like walking on marshmallows at all. But I live in Hawaii, the slipper capital of the world. I might be a little spoiled.The size 6-7 strap is really loose right out of the package. I normally wear a 6.5 and have a wider foot. And it\u2019s 2 sizes too big. I\u2019m thinking it would work if I was heavier but I\u2019m medium to thin build.I do like the chunky style. It looks really cute with rompers and jersey swing dresses that hit above the knee.I won\u2019t be returning these for a different size because according to the reviews it\u2019s a crapshoot. But I will keep these and hope they don\u2019t stretch out.I won\u2019t be buying another pair for myself but I can see how they would be a good gift.","2734":"I am a size 9.5 and the size 9\/10 fit great until I got them wet watering plants and left them out to dry in the sun. They shrank at least a whole shoe size. Before they were slightly big and now my heels hang off the back. Will definitely buy another pair but will beware of the sun!","2735":"They ate very comfortable to wear.","2736":"Wow. These shoes I bought them to walk around the house in. Light weight, good support, and super comfy. Highly recommend.","2737":"These are a wide fit. Nice and cushioning. Will be great for walking to the pool or beach. Rubber is definitely waterproof.Pleased with the shoes!","2738":"Para estar en casa","2739":"These are so very comfortable","2740":"Been trying to find a pair of these cloud slippers for a while now. Every pair I order is unbelievably oversized! I\u2019m normally a size 5 and these 4.5\/5 were HUGE on me. The color was also an ugly beige not \u201colive green\u201d as described. Returned due to the fact that they were so big they wouldn\u2019t even stay on my feet!","2741":"3 generations of cloud slip on.","2742":"Purchased 2 pairs of these as \"indoor shoes\". There seems to be some discrepancy in the sizing though. The black ones fit perfectly but the white ones were at least a full size too big and I ordered the same size in both. Great alternative to slippers as the weather gets warmer.  Very comfortable and exactly as described. I wear a size 9 and ordered women's size 9-10.  They are not a snug fit ... they are roomy  ... but not in a bad way. They stay on well and the proportions of the thickness of the sole and the foot strap are just right. Keeping the black ones but returning the white ones as they are too big even though they\u2019re the same size.","2743":"J'avais d\u00e9j\u00e0 achet\u00e9 une paire de couleur jaune que j'adore porter et maintenant je d\u00e9sirait avoir une paire de couleur noire.  Ces sandales sont tr\u00e8s confortables.","2744":"Got these for my mom. At first she thought they're too chunky and not as good looking but ended up loving them!","2745":"They are cute and comfy shoes. Only negative is that I originally ordered brown but got sent pink. Still keeping them though because they are still cute shoes.","2746":"These are the most comfortable slides I\u2019ve ever had! I want them in every colour! Way more comfortable than my slippers","2747":"very comfortable like walking on pillows..","2748":"I purchased the green ones a few months ago. Loved them. Wanted another color, ordered another color, same ones.Received what said was the same, but Clearly Very different sizing. They do not fit, too small.Very disappointed, will return the smaller beige pair. Wont order from them again.","2749":"Very comfortable!!!","2750":"Very comfortable slides. Great for the pool or hot tub. I wear them all the time","2751":"Top of slipper ripped the very 1st day.","2752":"Comfortable","2753":"You will regret buying it..","2754":"i love th\u00e8se pillow slides, theyre the comfiest things ever. new shoes usually hurt me one way or another but there was no way these shoes could. feels like heaven on your feet, i got the chocolate color and i love them. i\u2019m usually an 8.5 for shoes and i got the suggested size and fits perfect. on the snug side since the size is a range and the 8.5 is at the end of the range, so take that into consideration.","2755":"The flash in my pic and the online pic show a faint matcha colour but in reality it looks like an unflattering mucous color.Very comfy shoes from trying on ams size was right (true 8).I'd like to try a different colour but not sure if it's worth it","2756":"Ne dure pas d'la grandissent seulement et se creusent lorsqu'on les portent","2757":"S\u00faper agr\u00e9able","2758":"Very comfortable and soft but way too big.","2759":"Trop grandJ ai besoin d une \u00e9tiquette de retour","2760":"Est tres confortable","2761":"Not overly comfortable and could have probably gotten similar at the Dollar Store.  They fit well and will do for indoor shoes","2762":"Confortable et taille id\u00e9ale!","2763":"Fake the black have no name on them not half as comfortable as beige","2764":"These slides are super comfy and true to size. Great for the price point ordered another pair in black.","2765":"I thought that ordering the largest size of this shoe (13.5-14.5 women) would mean they would fit. Unfortunately I was wrong and am disappointed that I will not be able to wear these. I've never been a size 14 in my life and my foot is overhanging the back of the shoe by a good cm.","2766":"So comfortable, so much cushion. I work on my feet all day and walk home. I put these on as soon as I get home and it helps heel my feet. Highly recommended!!","2767":"These sandals are way too big.","2768":"It is poor-quality slippers that I have never seen in Canada. The price does not match the quality. Never buy any staff from the third-party market on the Amazon website. The label is to return to China though we buy in Canada. It may have Chinese custom cost occurred when shipping to China. Fortunately, I found out about this issue from the post office before shipping out. The key point is not just quality poor but the description of the product is not accurate and misleading to the consumers. Size is not accurate, broad single strap hugs are not broad at all. First time of such a Bad experience in my life. Please be alert for this  product .","2769":"Very comfortable and easy on feet.","2770":"True to size.  I very happy with the slides.  I find they comfortable and well made.","2771":"I have 2 pairs of these slides and I love them. I purchased this pair for my partner. I wasn't sure of the sizing. Ordered a size 40 for men's 9.5\/10 and they fit perfectly. They were supposed to be his house shoes but he loves them so much, he wears them outside too.","2772":"","2773":"They sent the item 5 sizes too small. It\u2019s like they didn\u2019t even try and send the right size. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning via UPS as they don\u2019t do Canada post. It\u2019s also took a long time to get here ans the colour \u201ckhaki\u201d which looks like it should be a nice beige\/tan colour, is a disgusting poop green\/beige vomit colour.Super disappointed. Never order from these sellers.","2774":"Returned,","2775":"They are so comfortable,  but they really are made for wide feet but I still love them!","2776":"My friend had these in beige and they were so cute and comfy I ordered them in black.  The black version is so cheap and ugly with flaws (uneven parts) in the shoe and pieces falling off.  To add insult to injury the shipping label says they came from Markham but I have to pay to send them back to China.  Do not waste your money.","2777":"Bought these to wear around the house. They are very squishy and comfortable, I like them instead of slippers as my feet are always warm.","2778":"The most comfortable and true to size.  Plan on buying another color","2779":"feels like a dream after you've been on your feet all day!","2780":"Cette pantoufle est d'un confort insoup\u00e7onn\u00e9 je l utilise m\u00eame pour des sortie bravo","2781":"LOVE these, have hand a handful of friends purchase after me being they are so comfy!","2782":"Every time I wear it, I feel relief. Going home from work with non-stop walking activity, the amount of support it provides to my feet is wonderful as I relax. Almost like walking with a comfy mattress under your feet. And its soft enough to keep my feet from making noisy steps especially in the evening when our basement neighbors are already asleep.","2783":"I bought these for daily use around the house and patio during summer. I\u2019m so happy with how comfortable they are and they even have grooves for the foot bed. I\u2019m a size 8.5 and the size is only slightly small for the first couple days. I find it feels better after wearing them for a couple of days. I even bought a pair for my mom thinking it might help her with her joint pain.","2784":"These are incredibly comfortable. Feels like you're walking on clouds. Bought 4 pair because I love them so much.","2785":"Loved the colour and how comfortable they are to walk in.","2786":"Fake and flimsy fbis is a scam because you can\u2019t even return it.","2787":"Confortable, mais pas autant que les Croc","2788":"Not happy with this product, didn't get the product that is advertised. Not the same shoe... wrong brand name. Truly disappointing and now it's going to cost me more to sent back. Disgusting"}}
